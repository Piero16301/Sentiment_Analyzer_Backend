They said you were a giant. They said you can crush a man's skull with one hand.,"Ridley Scott's Gladiator is not a perfect film I would think that the hardiest of fans of which I'm firmly one know this deep down. Yet just like Commodus in the film is keen to point out that he himself has other virtues that are worthy so does Gladiator the film. Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.In narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann's 1964 Epic The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience. And it bloody worked the influence and interest in all things Roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post Gladiator's success is there for all to see.What we do in life echoes in eternity.So no originality in story then. While some of the CGI is hardly ""Grade A"" stuff and there's a little over - mugging acting in support ranks as some of the cast struggle to grasp the period setting required yet the way Gladiator can make the emotionally committed feel - overrides film making irks. Crowe's Maximus is the man men want to be and the man women want to be with. As he runs through the gamut of life's pains and emotionally fortified trials and tribulations we are with him every step of the way urging him towards his day of revenge splattered destiny; with Crowe superb in every pained frame winning the Academy Award for Best Actor that he should have won for The Insider the previous year.Backing Crowe up is Joaquin Phoenix giving Commodus preening villainy and Connie Nielsen graceful as Lucilla (pitch Nielsen's turn here against that of Diane Kruger's in Troy to see the class difference for historical period playing). Oliver Reed leaving the mortal coil but leaving behind a spicy two fold performance as Proximo the Gladiator task master. Olly superb in both body and CGI soul. Richard Harris tugging the heart strings Derek Jacobi classy David Hemmings also while Djimon Hounso gives Juba - Maximus right hand man and confidante - a level of character gravitas that's inspiring.I didn't know man could build such things.Dialogue is literate and poetic resplendent with iconic speeches. Action is never far away but never at the expense of wrought human characterisations. The flaming arrows and blood letting of the Germania conflict kicks things off with pulse raising clarity and Scott and his team never sag from this standard. The gladiator arena fights are edge of the seat inducing the recreation for the Battle of Carthage a stunning piece of action sequence construction. And then the finale the culmination of two men's destinies no soft soaping from Scott and Crowe it lands in the heart with a resounding thunderclap. A great swords and sandals movie that tipped its helmet to past masters whilst simultaneously bringing the genre alive again. Bravo Maximus Decimus Meridius. 10/10",6 August 2014
As a matter of fact Maximus I AM entertained.,Gladiator is the best bread and circus. A moving and very entertaining action epic with Russel Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix at the top of their game.I absolutely love Joaquin Phoenix in this movie. He's the kind of villain you love to hate. So pathetic and childish. So ruthless and creepy. Just right amount of cartoonish. I wanted to punch him in the face.It can be corny and it drags a bit during the escape plan part of the plot but it has enough emotion and brutal violence to keep the audience entertained and that's what a good gladiator match should be.,11 October 2020
One of the best films ever,"There are so many iconic lines and quips in this film too many to countIt was easily the best film of the start of the millennium.""on my mark unleash hell!""""My name is Maximus Decimus Meridius commander of the Armies of the North General of the Felix Legions and loyal servant to the TRUE emperor Marcus Aurelius. Father to a murdered son husband to a murdered wife. And I will have my vengeance in this life or the next.""",6 April 2021
Are you entertained? Yes sir yes I am,How good is Russell Crowe though easily one of my favourite actors. Joaquin Phoenix play the role of a little weasel very well. Absolute classic of a film.,6 December 2020
Great,"Gladiator is a historical epic from director Ridley Scott. After being betrayed by the new Caesar Roman general Maximus is sold into slavery as a gladiator where he rises to fame as a people's champion and finds an opportunity to exact his revenge. Russell Crowe Joaquin Phoenix and Connie Nielsen lead the cast and deliver strong performances. Additionally the gladiator fights are especially dynamic and exciting featuring several different styles of combat. The costumes and sets are also remarkably well-done and create a vivid depiction of ancient Rome. And Hans Zimmer's score does an excellent job at capturing the tone of the film. Thrilling and action-packed Gladiator delivers a compelling tale. ""Are you not entertained?!""",24 February 2020
Spellbinding.,One of the best films of a generation it's a bold claim but Gladiator truly is that good. Every single element is perfect the story is phenomenal one to absorb you for the full running time. The visuals are incredible an epic masterpiece for the eyes as well as the soul. The acting first rate surely the aim of any film is to move you this does just that and then some.The best of Russell Crow are far as I'm concerned he really does command the screen throughout Joaquin Phoenix is just as good it makes me so sad that this was the last film of the late great Oliver Reed and of course he's awesome.I must also comment on the incredible soundtrack the sublime music of Has Zimmer coupled with the ancient enchanting voice of Lisa Gerrard the music is the same glorious standard as the film Now we are free still gives me chills and takes me back to the film.One of my top ten films of all time a masterpiece 10/10.,12 March 2022
Disturbing but beautifully made and well acted as well as jaw-dropping scenery!,Ridley Scott rarely disappoints with his films. All of them including the unjustly-maligned Legend are visually stunning and just show the director's artistic genius. Gladiator should be up there as one of the best films he's done if not the best. Almost everything on screen is very graphic making some scenes upsetting to watch but the visuals are just outstanding. The music score by Hans Zimmer just adds to the drama that is already there in the script. which is well written and rather Shakespearean. The performances were brilliant especially Joaquin Pheonix and Oliver Reed. Russell Crowe is wholly convincing in the title role and Richard Harris and Connie Nielson are also excellent. The costumes are brilliant as well as the sets. In conclusion Gladiator is a near masterpiece only marred by some upsetting scenes. 9/10 Bethany Cox.,15 May 2009
20 Years On It Still Rewards And Grips,20 years on the first DVD I bought is still a barnstorming thrilling ride. There's so much to recommend this - Lisa Gerrard & Hans Zimmer's iconic score the canny casting of Joaquin Phoenix as a foil for Crowe; the realisation that I quote this film in everyday conversation far more than I thought I did. If it should have won the Oscars is a moot point - this is another of Ridley Scott's superb worldbuilding - one of his primary film-making skills giving us a Rome that feels recognisable yet still a break from the clich√©'s that had seeped in to popular culture before this. That the film's status was boosted by the DVD boom as it made its way to home release is undeniable but this remains a film that thrills absorbs and grips.,21 August 2020
Both Old-Fashioned And Modern Gladiator Is An Intoxicating Blend Of Action Spectacle and Intimate Drama,Gladiator 2000's Best Picture winner was undoubtedly one of the biggest successes of the decade. It made tons of box-office cash nearly swept the Oscars and revitalized the sword-and-sandals genre for years to come. Does the movie warrant the massive success it received? For the most part yes. Ridley Scott's Roman blockbuster doesn't have quite the overwhelming emotion of another Oscar-winning epic Braveheart but as a brawny action spectacle Gladiator soars. With a strong story a profound sense of character and action and special effects that are suitably exciting Gladiator is a special kind of sword-and-sandals picture; One with a true dramatic core.Like the great epics of Hollywood's past Gladiator is simple in its story. Russell Crowe stars as the Roman General Maximus whose life is thrown into chaos after the jealous Emperor Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) arranges for his execution. Maximus is sold into slavery where he meets Proximo a former gladiator played by Oliver Reed who shepherds him through life as a gladiator as Commodus scrambles to stop Maximus' influence among the people. The story of Gladiator is a rock-solid tale of revenge bolstered by well written characters some sly political subtext and a couple of stellar performances from Crowe and Phoenix. The two principle characters Maximus and Commodus are what separates Gladiator from the slew of sword-and-sandals epics that came after it. They are simply but elegantly written as characters; Maximus a man singularly driven by a need to return to his family Commodus a confused young man singularly driven by a need to be loved. However it is the performances from Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix that really elevate this material. Phoenix gives a brilliant portrait of an emotionally frustrated young man. He is completely unpredictable but he never becomes campy. He is a real person with real problems and there is an underlying sadness to his character that makes him so much more interesting than your typical stock villain. As for Crowe his performance is all about physical presence. Apart from a few big emotional scenes Crowe's performance is one of quiet masculine stoicism. He adds a remarkable gravitas to this character that all but makes the movie. You feel for him you relate to him you root for him and you become inspired by him. It is a perfect heroic performance. The character stuff in Gladiator really works. Coming from a genre that made do with archetypal characters doing obligatory British accents for years it is nothing short of a revelation that Gladiator is such a fulfilling dramatic experience. Here are characters you actually care about and not simply placeholders to string up the plot in between action scenes.When it comes to general filmmaking Gladiator is rarely pedestrian and often astounding. Apart from some strange quirks in the filmmaking like the seemingly digitized zooms or the moments when the frame rate seems to cause a weird flicker effect Gladiator is a deep rich and meticulously detailed visual experience. Hollywood production values don't get much higher than this. The technical departments are tops in terms of production design and costuming. The movie looks expensive but there is something else in Gladiator's visual style that keeps your eyes glued to the screen. The look of the film with its mix of traditional large- scale sets and CG enhancements is almost dreamlike. The environments of Ridley Scott's version of ancient Rome including a painstakingly crafted digital recreation of the famous Colosseum seem untethered to any kind of physical reality. It's as if what Scott has created is an environment that reflects the feeling of Ancient Rome rather than the reality of it. Just as with the deep characters and eloquent script there's a modern feeling to Ridley Scott's filmmaking in Gladiator. The reliance on CGI is sometimes overdone but in conjunction with the costumes sets and impressively grandiose score from Hans Zimmer it adds to the intoxicating atmosphere of Ridley Scott's world.The main attraction of Gladiator is its scenes of gladiatorial combat and on that front Ridley Scott aptly gets the job done. There are a few moments when Scott falls back on to standard sword clashing and disorientating shaky cam but for the most part the action scenes are exciting bloody and imaginatively staged. The best action scenes are the opening Barbarian battle and a fantastic fight scene between Maximus a veteran gladiator and a Colosseum full of bloodthirsty tigers. In those scenes Scott's emphasis on close-up sweaty brutal action is totally effective. I felt the cold of the forest mud the heat of the flaming trees the sharpness of the swords and the dusty claustrophobia of the Arena. The action of Gladiator is visceral and bloody and there is plenty of it. Those hungry for bloodsport will find more than enough manly derring-do to satiate their red-blooded desire.For all its dramatic depth I can't say I came out of Gladiator heavily affected by feeling. This is still at its core a visceral experience but the small character moments and the textured performances are miraculously riveting. I was intrigued by every second of Gladiator. The action scenes are thrilling the dramatic scenes are mesmerizing and the $103 million budget is all up there on the screen in every frame. Ridley Scott's direction is superlative especially in the third act as the story action and emotions reach a fever pitch. The last few scenes including the climactic final showdown and the closing 'Elysium' scene exhibit a crescendo of the kind of daring artistry that permeates the film's best sections. Gladiator is a meaty Hollywood epic of the best kind. It's visually sumptuous and supremely thrilling but there is a beating heart within this beast. Sure there are a couple of bumps along the way but with Crowe as the sturdy hero and a simple story of returning home Gladiator stays with you long after the credits roll.92/100,9 July 2017
A Throwback To The Epics Of The '60s,"An intense Roman epic a la ""Ben-Hur"" or ""Spartacus"" it was nice to see something like this made again. It had been since the 1960s that we had seen a 3-hour extravaganza like this.Like Ben-Hur this is a story of a successful man who loses everything thanks to an evil man and then has to fight his way back up to seek revenge on that man and to obtain his freedom back. It's a tried-and-true formula. This movie doesn't go to excess on the violence as some of the other more recent epic films did such as ""Braveheart"" or ""The Patriot.""The acting is excellent beginning with Russell Crowe who has established himself as one of the best actors of today. Joaquin Phoenix also put himself ""on the map"" as an actor with his portrayal of the evil ""Commodus."" He's so annoying you want to slap that sucker which means he's doing a good job acting. Kudos to the rest of the cast too.Too bad they don't make more of these type of films as they did in the 1950s and 1960s.",1 November 2006
Why don't they make films like this anymore,Seriously the best fantasy film of the modern area with great acting and emotional rollercoastering all the way through. The soundtrack by Zimmer really propels this film,18 February 2019
Timeless. A modern day classic. Epitome of an epic. An all-time great.,"""Are you not entertained?!?!""One of the most perfect movies ever made. The pacing the characterization & development. Hans Zimmer's score. John Mathieson's cinematography. Career-making acting from Russell Crowe Joaquin Phoenix Connie Nielsen & Djimon Hounsou. Everything is on point.This movie is an integral part of Ridley Scott's holy trinity along with Blade Runner & Alien. Endlessly rewatchable. Endlessly quotable. An epic tragedy on the level of Shakespeare & Ancient Greece.This movie will be just as popular a hundred years from now and no movie about Ancient Rome will have topped it.",17 February 2021
Edge of Your Seat Fun!,"Great Story! Great Writing! Great Acting! Great Directing! Great Score! This movie has it all. I especially enjoyed the mood of the film. Even though it has a lot of action there is a subtle elegance throughout the picture that gives it great style. The movie flows effortlessly from scene to scene while at the same time creating wonderful intensity and nail-biting excitement.The acting in the movie more than lives up to expectations. Russell Crowe is brilliant in his role as Maximus the ""general who became a slave who became a gladiator who defied an emperor."" Crowe's intense style is perfect for the relentless determination and confidence of Maximus. Joaquin Phoenix is equally wonderful in his role as Commodus the corrupt emperor. He plays a great villain because he is able to give Commodus depth by showing certain vulnerable or fragile sides while at the same time instantly transforming to let the ruthless nature of his volatile character shine. It also helps that Joaquin has the classic Caesar look that works perfectly with his role.Connie Nielsen is also very good as Lucilla. However perhaps the two finest performances in the movie were given by a couple of acting veterans in supporting roles. Richard Harris and Oliver Reed were exceptional in what will be remembered as crowning achievements at the end of their careers. Harris was perfect as Marcus Aurelius the aging Caesar who reflects upon his life and contemplates how the world will remember him. And Reed especially gave my personal favorite performance in the movie as Proximo the trainer for the gladiators. The way he spoke about the life of a gladiator the splendor of Rome and the ""thrill of the Coliseum"" really added excitement and anticipation during the viewing of the movie.Gladiator is filled with many memorable moments that one would need to see more than once to fully appreciate. The excitement felt for me when Rome is first shown in all its wonder and marvel is my favorite scene. But the whole movie is a rush! Hans Zimmer provides the absolute perfect score to capture the different moods in the movie. Ridley Scott sets the perfect tone with his artistic and creative directing. I would recommend it to anyone who can stomach intensity and enjoy an epic story for the ages. Next to Braveheart this movie is the greatest of all-time!",19 February 2001
Amazing movie,This movie is amazing every soul should see this Russell Crowe deserved the Oscar,29 December 2020
Special effects and powerful acting make Gladiator an epic.,I borrowed this movie on DVD but I wish I had seen it in the theater for it would have been a lot more fun and powerful there. Despite this Gladiator is one of the most powerful and moving films I've ever seen. The plot goes so smooth together as well as the acting and the terrific musical score. Director Ridley Scott puts all effort into making this film an epic and he does just that. I'd have to say that anyone who likes Ridley Scott (I sure do) should see this. It is a lot like Ridley's other movies (Black Hawk Down was also amazing). If you can stand a little bit--well ok a LOT of blood and gore then you should see this. Russell Crowe shows an excellent performance like no other. I don't think there's one bad movie that Ridley Scott has made or that Russell Crowe has acted in. The fact that the brutal battles involving innocent slaves in this film actually happened in real life centuries ago makes it even more interesting and powerful. Emperor Commodus is a truely evil and life-like villian who shows a lot of his wits in attempts to get his revenge against Maximus.Ridley Scott went to many different locations to shoot this film to make it real and he does. The film is set in Rome and it looks just like it. You feel as if you are there in the crowd hearing them cheer and cheer to see the death. To some of you this may sound a little barbaric and believe me the film is VERY barbaric and brutual however it teaches a very strong lesson of what happens when an economy turns as violent as Rome was. Ridley Scott goes to many lengths to make this movie real because even though the characters are fictitious all of this really did happen. Innocent people had to go through brutual fighting while thousands of people cheered for either their death or the enemy's death. If you were an inexperienced fighter chances are you would get killed. But the strange thing is that Rome LOVED this. People came from all over to see these fights and to see the blood that was shed that is why you can't blame the characters in this film for being so forlorn and saddened the whole time. The film itself is very dark. The theme is dark and the ending is dark. From beginning to end there is excessive violence (for those action movie-goers this is a movie for you). But if the violence is concerning you don't let it. The special effects make the movie great but it's the acting and storyline that make it spectacular. HIGHLY RECCOMMENDED for anyone who wants a good time. Definitely makes you think. ***** out of *****.,6 March 2002
Cecil B DeMille eat your heart out,"The epic blockbuster returns with the 21st Century's answer to Cecil B DeMille Ridley Scott and his dramatic tale of courage and revenge GLADIATOR - ""the general who became a slave the slave who became a gladiator the gladiator who defied an emperor"".Once a great roman General and as good as adopted son of Marcus Aurelius Caesar (Harris) Maximus (Crowe) is forced into exile by Commodus (Phoenix) heir to the throne after the death of Marcus. Saved from death by slavers he is purchased for use as a gladiator by Proximo (Reed) and ends up in the arena of all arena's the Colloseum where he proves unbeatable under his guise as ""The Spaniard"".And with a budget of over $100m Scott certainly delivers the goods. GLADIATOR transcends the notion of 'blockbuster' that we have become accustomed to in the age of electronic and special effects wizardry and instead offers a good old fashioned action film along the lines of Spartacus and and Ben Hur. Not only are we drawn into an archetypal story that contains all the classic elements a filmgoer could dream of (love loss courage despair good triumphing over evil etc etc) - also on offer is a visual feast of cinematic painting after painting - a rich tapestry of images that are breathtaking and ultimately visually satisfying. From the plains of Germania to the desert stronghold of Zuchobar and finally to great Rome herself John Mathiesion the cinematographer is to be commended highly for his general inventiveness and ability to capture so much on film. The opening battle scene is superb as a cast of thousands erupt across the screen and provide an indication that we are about to see a film that pays incredible attention to detail throughout its entirety. In every way Scott has created a world for us that scuttles films of similar epic undertakings (and budgets!) and sends them to their dooms at the bottom of the murky depths of film history where they belong.The cast is generally very strong. Crowe proves himself very suitable to the task with a great emotional range and depth of character. His accent ocassionally bugged me (as did the mish mash of accents on offer - but that is I guess a legacy of 'internationally casted films') but this aside he was well and truly up to the task. Phoenix is also excellent as the disturbed Commodus as is Nielson as Lucilla the daughter of Marcus who ""should have been a son"" and finds herself torn between loyalty to her brother and doing what is 'right'. The old guard thesps of Harris Reed and Jacobi (Grachus) are uniformly strong as supporting characters and Spencer Treat Clark (Lucius) does a fine job as the young heir to the throne.Add to this great cast excellent editing and post production work and an intricate soundscape (including a magnificent Hans Zimmer score) and you have a film that despite its length was highly palatable and had me in there from beginning to end. A must see.",2 May 2000
Can't be missed!,"""Gladiator"" definitely is a classic film as it combines a simple but moving story with beautiful scenery filming direction and score ¬ñ it is truly a ""complete"" movie.I am mostly compelled with the beautiful script which in a way reminds me of poetry though it is still everyday language. I love the acting portrayed by the late Oliver Reed and also Richard Harris. Russell Crowe Djimon Housou and Joaquin Phoenix are also superb and the parts suit them perfectly. There are also a number of less ""popular"" artists who also deserve a big ""bravo"". Amongst them I have to mention ex-Mr Universe Ralph Moeller who is mostly used as the comic relief of the movie. In Gladiator we can also the beautiful and popular Maltese TV Star and actress Ruth Frendo who although has a small part she is totally brilliant and outstanding.Actually I got to IMDb while I was looking for her name on the internet in fact on IMDb she has some very stunning photos. I was lucky to meet Ruth Frendo whilst she was filming in another Maltese production. Ruth Frendo is not only a gorgeous and talented actress but she is also amazingly intelligent and very down-to-earth. We will definitely be seeing more of her work in the future... The scenery used for ""Gladiator"" is brilliant ¬ñ and the opening battle scene is definitely one of my top favorite scenes. The modern camera technique contrasts sharply to the brutality of the gladiators actions and blood shed during the movie; and I love the light contrasts thanks to the lenses which most definitely have been used to create a surreal feel to the entire movie.""Gladiator"" deserves all the awards and great reviews it has received and for those of you who still haven't gone and watched it ¬ñ I can assure you that it will be well worth your time and money. So go on and rent it now!",12 September 2005
Breathtaking!,Once again Director Ridley Scott proves to be as professional as one can be. The recreation of ancient Rome is splendid with all its magnificent buildings and atmosphere and he is able to show with all brightness the greatness of the Roman Empire with its political problems and military discipline and love and treason of hate and jealousy that still have a place in our world today. But the story has a glow of its own to which all the beautiful scenery (believe me it's awesome!!!) and great cinematography are just balancing factors. The plot is a rich one that is as dynamic as it is present. He once again after Blade Runner 1492 and others helps us visit the depths of the human soul which remains the same over all our historical and social experience. Even the fights are displayed in such a way that all the blood is quite discrete but still making us feel like screaming and jumping out of our seats. I would also like to point out the performances of the cast that is surprisingly good. We have some actors and actresses who are not Hollywood icons but are are greatly able to move the audience among screams and tears. All in all we have guys like Russel Crowe who are coming out to be part of a new and extremely promising harvest of people who are making each time more fans around the world. Well you should see for yourself!,6 June 2000
A Very Good Movie That Could Have Been Even Better,"The beginning of ""Gladiator"" is powerful. We see the Roman Legion fighting against the Germanic tribes in what surely must be one of the most spectacular battle scenes ever filmed; one which truly does give the viewer a taste of what warfare in that era must have been like. The ending is powerful as the quest for vengeance finally comes to a head with General Maximus facing the Emperor Commodus in a gladiatorial contest in the Roman arena. In between - well - things could have been a little better.The acting in this movie I thought was first-rate. Russell Crowe as General Maximus Joaquin Phoenix as Emperor Commodus and Connie Nielsen as Lucilla sister of Commodus all played their parts perfectly. The gladiatorial bouts were superbly choreographed. The set decoration was magnificent and looked exactly as I would expect Imperial Rome to have looked. So why do I say this could have been better?(POSSIBLE SPOILERS)Basically the whole thing was just a bit too clear-cut for me. Maximus was too obviously the good guy Commodus too obviously the bad guy. With this being so clear we know that the movie must be heading for the final confrontation between the two and it makes watching the middle 90 minutes or so difficult. ""Get on with it"" I found myself thinking from time to time. It didn't have to be quite so clear cut. The potential was there to give the viewer a real ethical choice to make. I mean one can understand Commodus being angry when Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) - his father - takes away the throne that Commodus had believed all his life would be his and hands control of Rome over to Maximus. Commodus could have been a sympathetic character. He didn't have to murder his father. His father was elderly; a natural death wouldn't have been out of the question. And why the incestuous fascination with Lucilla? I didn't think it added anything to the movie - except to make Commodus even more repulsive. In the end the movie didn't make me think about anything; it didn't challenge me with any moral decision-making; it didn't make choosing sides in this battle even remotely difficult.Don't get me wrong. This was a very good movie. One can always argue whether this movie or that should have been named best picture; one certainly has to agree that ""Gladiator"" was worthy of consideration. I just felt it could have been better. In the end I give it a rating of 7/10.",24 March 2002
A nail biting intense modern epic!,Most films require that the viewer identifies with the character to truly be engrossed with the film. If you can't feel something for the character than the audience is lost.Luckily in Ridley Scott's case Russel Crowe is so captivating and convincing as a general loved by his troops and as a slave loved by the people that the movie really works. Possibly one of the greatest actors today Crowe carries this epic film on his very capable shoulders.Not to say that he is the only reason this works. The supporting cast most notably Connie Neilsen buoy the film to new perspectives.Jacquin Phoenix definitely captures the egotisitcal persona he should display stealing every scene he's in. Phoenix will surely be put on the map with Gladiator.But the real shining star in this film are the incredible action sequences which jolt the viewer right in with the opening sequences as Maximus' true worth to the Roman Empire is displayed. Scott's camera work within these completed sequences takes a modern twist that really works for the gruesome scenes.Crowe will now get the respect he deserves for this collosal performance. Gladiator makes the most of its 2 and a half hours marking a triumphant comeback for the long forgotten epics of the classic days of film. ALL HAIL MAXIMUS!,3 May 2000
A general who became a slave. A slave who became a gladiator. A gladiator who defied an emperor.,This movie is awesome! I think it's great to be in one of IMDb's top 250 best movies because it deserves it. Every time I watch 'Gladiator'I stay touched by the story and I never get bored of it.It's one of the most excellent movies already made in the movie's history! Russel Crowe is terrific in the role of Maximus and so is Joaquim phoenix great as commodus. For people who enjoys historyspecially ancient historyis a chance to see how was Rome many centuries ago and also know better about the gladiators the Colosseum and how some things worked in that time.I will not write about the plot here because many people already did this; I will only say for people that never watched this movie that it deserves to be watched and if you have some money buy the DVD!,24 October 2005
The Glory that was Rome was of another day,35 years after Samuel Bronston and Anthony Mann gave us The Fall Of The Roman Empire Ridley Scott told the same tale of the Emperor Commodus and his problems succeeding his legendary father Emperor/philosopher Marcus Aurelius. Neither film got the story right both have him killing his father and both have him with a hero/rival. In the Mann film it's Stephen Boyd in this film it is Russell Crowe. Both have a sister working against him Sophia Loren in the Mann film and in the Ridley Scott film Connie Nielsen.Although I loved Christopher Plummer in The Fall Of The Roman Empire truth be told Joaquin Phoenix is closer to the real Commodus. Commodus was only a teen when he became Emperor in 180 AD and reigned a lot longer than it seemed in Gladiator. In real life he was strangled by a wrestler who was part of a conspiracy. He did in fact love the Coliseum and did like to participate occasionally as is shown in both films.In this film when Joaquin Phoenix learns that Richard Harris as Marcus Aurelius plans to name Russell Crowe one of his best fighting generals as his successor he kills Harris and Crowe's family. Crowe is sold off in bondage but works his way back to Rome to take Phoenix down.Gladiator marks he farewell film of Oliver Reed who plays the head of the gladiator school who trains Crowe. Derek Jacobi plays a senator and as he did in I Claudius dreams of reestablishing the republic.Gladiator won for Best Picture and Best Actor for Russell Crowe and also won for costume design special effects and best sound. Sharp film fans will see bits of both Ben-Hur and Spartacus woven into the story.Gladiator is a well put together drama and Crowe and Phoenix have quite an acting duel. Maybe the real Commodus story will get a film one day. Until then Gladiator and The Fall Of The Roman Empire will do nicely.,4 October 2020
One of the Greatest Movies Ever,I love history and to me Gladiator is a masterpiece. It is the most accurate picture of the Roman Empire Hollywood has ever put out. People declare Spartacus a masterpiece but Gladiator far outdoes Spartacus in quality. The costuming the acting the screenplay the scenery and the fighting styles made me think that I had traveled back to 180 A.D. Russell Crowe is a true Hollywood tough guy and he is superb in this movie. Joaquin Phoenix is outstanding as a villain one of the best in movie history. He played his character as if it were a psychologist's dream case. Connie Nielsen plays one of the strongest female characters that I have ever seen. The choreographer of the action sequences was brilliant. Ridley Scott did an outstanding job in recreating the Empire including the multitude of ethnic groups within the Empire and accurately depicting everyday life. If you're looking for insight into what the Roman Empire was like this is a perfect depiction.,7 September 2002
Epic spectacle,An epic awe-inspiring movie which thankfully shows us that Hollywood hasn't forgotten how to make good movies anymore this is a film which has it all from intrigue to suspense to violence to subtle romance. Forget any of the other CGI-laden rubbish filling out the multiplexes this is a film which simply has to be seen at the cinema - or alternatively on a very big television screen indeed. Due to the fact that this film was hyped up incredibly it doesn't actually live up to the hype but nothing could have done. GLADIATOR is pure old-fashioned escapism nothing less.For once the acting is totally flawless. Russell Crowe comes out of nowhere to give us a powerful sensitive action hero able to emote without the use of dialogue delivering his lines when needed with a gruff British accent. Crowe is a revelation here - I hated him in VIRTUOSITY but his acting is excellent and finely judged right up there with the brooding intensity of De Niro or Pacino. He is well supported by a varied cast including Connie Nielsen who makes a very sultry and alluring love interest. Joaquin Phoenix makes his snivelling whining emperor truly despicable easily soaking up the entire audience's hatred. Oliver Reed is also very good in what was to be his final role as the proud but friendly slave owner who becomes Maximus' friend. Richard Harris lends an air of nobility and authenticity in his brief role as the dying emperor Caesar while noted British actors Derek Jacobi and David Hemmings appear as senators.Okay so the plot of revenge is a fairly clich√©d one and the plot here is reminiscent of a whole number of other films as well as MACBETH but it is given added power and resonance by the great acting. The music score is also absolutely excellent and really adds to this film's atmosphere. Physically it is beautifully made and extremely realistic - you constantly feel that you're in Rome itself. Everything is epic and the whole film is chock-full of grandeur. It looks lovely it sounds lovely hell it is lovely.Director Ridley Scott doesn't skimp on the gore front either leaving in some gruesome shots of people being cut in half being decapitated and blood spraying in the air and all over the place. The battle scenes are the highlight of the film and are filmed in a weird way - sometimes sped up sometimes slowed down - which make them so realistic that you do feel like you're there. They're also very exciting with Crowe taking on ferocious tigers masked hulking warriors and chariots too. The twists and turns in the plot are unexpected and there's a moving poignant ending giving this film an extra element. Old-fashioned well-crafted and truly splendid - any movie fan owes it to themselves to see this film.,22 July 2016
The most perfect movie ever made,Rewatched this movie today. I am convinced it is the most perfect movie ever made. It has a strong female character positive and realistic minority rep (the Roman Empire extended into Africa and I think lots of people forget that) and a compelling revenge plot. Every line moves the plot forward and is memorable. The music is gorgeous. The acting is impeccable. The visuals are absolutely stunning - especially the rose petals raining down as the emperor is ascending on the platform. The visual of the emperor dead in the colosseum while the crowd lifts Maximus away. The whole concept of Elysium makes me cry every time. The ending couldn't have wrapped everything up better.,11 December 2020

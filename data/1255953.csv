A stunning and powerful thriller,Want to see where one of the modern era's hottest directing streaks started? If you do then Incendies in the film for you.Directed by Denis Villeneuve who went from this French/Canadian co-production to move onto Prisoners Enemy Sicario Arrival and last year's brilliant sequel Blade Runner 2049 Incendies is the Oscar nominated film that put Villeneuve on the path he finds himself on now and remains a film of substantial power these years on from initial release.Adapted from Wajdi Mouawad's play of the same name Incendies is a multi-layered narrative that spans both numerous countries and numerous characters over various timelines but Villeneuve controls his film perfectly as the mystery that lays at the heart of this tale about family war life and death never gets muddled as we're drawn further and further into a film that wraps us up in its web and refuses to let us go.There's not the abundance of filmmaking and visual flair that Villeneuve has started to become known for over his more recent Hollywood productions but Incendies power comes almost exclusively from Villeneuve's deft hand with his performers his handling of a script that other filmmakers would struggle to bring to life and his ability to slowly ebb out more information as we go that by the time we come to realise just what lays in store for the films characters the power of Incendies becomes even more apparent.Saying to much about this story would be a disservice to a film that takes many various turns and pivots. Essentially at its core a story of both twins Jeanne and Simon Marwan trying to uncover the secret of their father they've never met and find a brother they never knew they had after their Middle Eastern born mother Nawal passes away Incendies becomes so much more than a typical family drama as it showcases time in the conflict of the Israeli and Palestinian Holy Wars as well as the twins journey back to their country of nationality.The film in many ways showcases a different side to Villeneuve and proves the director is just as at home handling a $150 million plus Sci-Fi for a major Hollywood studio as he is behind the camera of a small intimate drama that is driven purely by its narrative and characters. Proof the filmmaker is a man of many talents and a director to be cherished by those that love cinema.Final Say - For any fans of Villeneuve's work world cinema or powerful character driven dramas then Incendies should be a film you seek out as soon as possible. Losing none of its power since its initial release this sometimes hard to watch but always enthralling film is standout filmmaking and the official blasting off point for one of the modern era's great filmmakers.5 swimming pools out of 5,8 May 2018
One word: INCREDIBLE!,Initially the film can be a bit confusing due to them continually jumping back in time. Once you get the hang of it though and get to know the characters it is easy enough to follow.This is essentially two films in one: the story of a mother searching for the son she had to give up at birth and a story about twins searching for their father and a brother they never knew they had. The film takes us on an incredible journey filled with action suspense drama and more than just a few twists.'Incendies' effectively illustrates the horrors of war and killings in the name of religion. What an absolutely fantastic script. This is one of the most amazing films I've seen in a while.,16 November 2019
Our Love Became a Funeral Pyre,When people watch the Oscars they don't usually care about the Best Foreign Film nominees. Incendies provides so many reasons why people should actually get to see those nominees at all costs. Incendies is the kind of film that one walks away from feeling emotionally drained one where it stays in the viewer's mind for days on end. Like an intense personal experience it takes a lot to come to grips with the film's story a moving plot full of twists and catharsis. At the New Directors/New Films Festival in New York at which I saw this last night Denis Villeneuve explained that he has made four films in Canada but this is the first one to be released in America. Right now I see no reason why Villeneuve or any of the actors for that matter shouldn't have a great future ahead of them.Based on the play Scorched by Wajdi Mouawad Incendies follows a non-linear plot that spans two generations. In the present day Jeanne and Simon are twins who have lost their mother Nawal. Nawal has stipulated in her will that Jeanne and Simon must return an envelope to the brother they didn't know existed who is currently living in a fictional Middle Eastern country. Only then can the twins give Nawal a proper burial. Jeanne feels obligated to return the letter so she goes to the Middle East only to realize some of Nawal's nastiest secrets. As Jeanne uncovers more about Nawal the viewer is shown Nawal's story. The film builds up to an unforgettable ending that is sure to rock any viewer.Incendies already had great source material. I've praised the plot enough but one thing I must add is that the play is apparently four hours long according to Villeneuve. It's impressive that this movie succeeds so nicely because I can't imagine that anything was cut. But to back up that source material there's some really great acting. The entire cast plays their parts with such an emotional vigor that it seems impossible that this work of art wasn't autobiographical.Furthermore Villeneuve has made a film that relies on great filmmaking to impact the viewer. The cinematography is beautifully bland surely a nod to some of the deserts in the Lebanon- like land where the movie takes place. Color scheme is also used to Villeneuve's advantage to show the parallels between Nawal and Jeanne's lives. Villeneuve seems to love working with extended zoom shots that shock the viewer with their overwhelmingly long silences. Why Villeneuve didn't receive critical acclaim (in America at least) before Incendies is a mystery.There are many movies about the Middle East. Some have failed miserably in their attempts to strike an emotional chord with critics and viewers alike (Redacted Rendition) but others have been extremely successful (The Hurt Locker Lebanon). Incendies could very well be one of the best films ever made about the conflicts in the Middle East. It has its flaws which keep it from being a masterpiece (maybe it could've lost five or ten minutes) but it is that rare type of film that really resonates beyond the initial viewing. Hopefully Incendies will be remembered for years to come as the little brilliant film that spawned the great fame of Denis Villeneuve.,26 March 2011
Powerful gripping plot with great direction and acting,"Incendies (2010) is a Canadian film that was co-written and directed by Denis Villeneuve. The movie stars Lubna Azabal as Nawal Marwan ""The Woman Who Sings."" In the opening of the film we learn that Nawal has just died leaving some unusual instructions for her two children in her will.Then there's a flashback where we learn that Nawal as a teenager has given birth to an out-of-wedlock infant. The rest of the plot follows from those two starting points.Mélissa Désormeaux-Poulin portrays Jeanne Marwan and Maxim Gaudette portrays her twin Simon Narwam. Désormeaux-Poulin has the larger role and she is superb. Lubna Azabal is equally good as Nawal.The plot involves a quest journey and the quest is achieved. However for me the point of the movie wasn't whether or not the mystery would be solved. The point was to see that war--especially sectarian war--causes immense suffering to everyone involved.This isn't a feel-good film. Yes--we know the answers in the end. However except for one powerful scene involving a nurse there's no joy or happiness for anyone. That makes the movie hard to watch but it's so powerful that it's worth watching anyway.The movie worked well on DVD. It has an incredible IMDb rating of 8.3. (This may be the highest rated film that I've ever reviewed.) I thought it was even better than that and rated it 10.",26 June 2020
Unforgettable,A bona fide masterpiece. As simple as that. It is ironic that one of the best films about the Middle East conflict and specifically the tragic civil war in Lebanon should be made by a Canadian film maker. Incendies is based on a play but it feels as though it has been adapted from a great literary work. In fact there is no specific mention of any country in the film but no one can be in any doubt that the unnamed country is Lebanon.A Canadain-Lebanese woman dies in Canada and in her will she leaves two letters to her twin son & daughter. One is to be delivered to their brother (whom they did not know existed) and the other to their father (whom they had presumed dead). To find these people they have to travel to Lebanon to unravel the mysterious past of their deceased mother. As we follow their search flash backs slowly reveal to us key moments in the life of their mother.There are extremely powerful and unforgettable images and scenes in Incendies. Suffice to say that even if you have no interest in the history of the Middle East this film will capture your attention from the start and grips you right till the end. It is the third great film (and arguably the best)that I've seen on this topic after Waltz with Bashir and Lebanon. All of these are essential viewing.,15 October 2010
A work of devastating power...,"""Incendies (Scorched)"" opened in town this Friday just days before it made the short list of nominees for Best Foreign Film for this year's Academy Awards. It played in the Vancouver International Film Festival 2010 but I missed it then.Fortunately it received theatrical distribution; this devastating film on the horrors of conflict and its enormous human costs simply must be seen. Denis Villeneuve's searing work his fourth feature is based on the celebrated play of the same name by Montreal native and artistic director of the French Theatre at the National Arts Centre in Ottawa Wajdi Mouawad. While there is no doubting the immediacy and impact it must have had as a piece of theatre ""Incendies"" benefits from the transition to the larger canvas of the big screen appropriate for the epic themes and emotional conflagrations it tackles.When their mother dies and her will is read twins Jeanne and Simon Marwan are stumped by its bizarre burial instructions. Nawal Marwan states that she must be interred naked and facing away from the sun in an unmarked grave until the two letters she has left with the family notary are delivered on her behalf. One is addressed to the father the twins believed dead the second to a son whose existence comes as a complete surprise to them. The will makes the twins realize that they did not know their mother at all. They have not had an easy relationship with her and are understandably reluctant to comply with her terms.The daughter Jeanne moved away and found refuge in the abstract realms of pure mathematics. Her sibling Simon who remained at home had the more complicated relationship because he dealt daily with Nawal's strangeness. Jeanne agrees to deliver the letter that was left to her and embarks on an odyssey of discovery in search of the father she has never known. Later she convinces Simon to join her.Although the Middle Eastern country is never named in the film Wajdi Mouawad ascribes the inspiration for his play to Soha Becharra a woman who was imprisoned for six years in Khiam southern Lebanon. In an interview with the Montreal Gazette he explained ""For me the success of this play and the film is a way to give back some life to a woman whose life was taken away from her."" The cinematic endeavor is hugely powerfully successful: as Jeanne scours an alien land for clues of her mother's past we see Nawal's tough life in flashback in the same locations that her daughter visits for the first time. Sectarian strife tribal and religious warfare family blood feuds and honor killings have been the blight of the Middle East and areas as far as Afghanistan and what is now Pakistan and parts of Africa. Bloodshed and violence have been a way of life; each side claims to be justified in killing to avenge earlier injustices. While humankind has not lost its baser urges—we just have to recall the recent incident of the young Afghani woman whose nose was hacked off or the countless rapes in present day DR Congo—the film is a plea for reconciliation and forgiveness to bring about the much needed change.Nawal barely escapes an honor killing due to her unwed pregnancy gives up her baby son for adoption and spends the rest of her life looking for this lost child. Along the way she takes sides in the violence and is imprisoned for fifteen years for shooting a political leader. Upon her release she begins life anew in Canada with her infant twins the outcome of brutal rape at the hands of a torturer. Regardless of the change in geography she remains haunted by the past and her unending quest for her lost child. How does one look for reparation and justice when the perpetrators frequently flee the country of their misdeeds and seek asylum elsewhere? As she has not kept her word to her son to return to him she feels unworthy of a proper burial. A character in the film wisely observes that death always leaves its traces and Jeanne and Simon finally get to know their mother from the relics of her life.The Belgian actress Lubna Azabal's heroic performance brings Nawal to awe-inspiring Brechtian life. Undefeated by each dehumanizing blow she stoically navigates a war-crazed world devoid of any sense her driving force is the need to reunite with her son. Mélissa Désormeaux-Poulin and Maxim Gaudette do excellent work as the siblings who gradually begin to understand their mother. Rémy Girard and Allen Altman playing the Canadian and Middle Eastern notaries respectively guide the siblings through their search while Abdelghafour Elaaziz makes an impact in the small but important role of Abou Tarek the torture specialist. The rest of the characters are brought to life by a talented cast of unknown actors; in their hands even the smallest roles acquire great significance. Denis Villeneuve's film honors the stories of these people by rigorously avoiding directorial excesses. Events and stories this powerful do not require embellishment and Villeneuve's spare dispassionate directorial style maximizes impact.Someone remarked that ""Incendies"" is the closest contemporary approximation of Greek tragedy and I agree with this assessment: the crimes and consequences are universal and timeless and if a film holds up a mirror to question our capacity for barbarism it is reason to applaud. Regardless of the outcome at the Academy Awards ""Incendies"" is a major achievement for Canadian cinema.",26 January 2011

A Nutshell Review: Incendies,The film begins in sweeping slow motion centered around a harsh cemented premises with a bunch of boys undergoing the shaving of their hair ala military fashion with the camera centered on one boy possessing this crazed looking eyes before cutting to Canada where twins Jeanne and Simon Marwan (Melissa Desormeaux-Poulin and Maxim Gaudette respectively) arrive at a notary's office to accept the will of their recently deceased mother Nawal (Lubna Azabal) where they are left with letters to deliver to a father and brother that they do not know. In the meantime they are to bury their mother in a certain strange way until their quest has been completed with the notary Jean Lebel (Remy Girard) Nawal's boss the last few years ensuring that her last will and testament is completed the way it was intended.Incendies based upon the play Scorched written by Wajdi Mouawad and adapted for the screen by director Denis Villeneuve was this year's Best Foreign Language Film nominee from Canada and there's every reason why it was a nomination well deserved. Set against a mystery to be unraveled so slowly bringing together seemingly disparate events together in shocking fashion by the time we're through the narrative is split into two different timelines with the current one being the twins' journey to an unnamed Middle Eastern country in search for clues to their unknown father and brother while with each milestone achieved of sorts we get to see a flashback to the time of their mother brought up in a harsh environment involving the staining of family honour as well as religious zealots and militants who set her off in a tale of an avenging angel and sacrifice.And the story sprawls in many directions though with Villeneuve always having an assured hand in not having this fall into melodramatic terms nor have any wasted scenes highlighting issues that still exist to this very day involving hatred revenge and forgiveness but not before laying down a number of surprises that will shake you to the core especially when the mysterious equation finally gets solved – you may get a hint of what's to come but this got handled so expertly without being verbatim that it accentuates and compounds the myriad of complex emotions felt by all the characters involved.With sweeping cinematography that's achingly beautiful to gaze at one of the best scenes involve the brutal cold blooded mass murder where militants spray countless of rounds into a packed bus culminating in that shot of a burning bus shrouded in thick black smoke against an endless sandy environment with Nawal finally snapping into making a decision to take matters into her own hands from then on. Between the two stories perhaps it is Nawal's painful journey that makes this compelling viewing from having her lover forcefully and terminally separated from her by family during her teens then her volunteering and sacrifice leading to imprisonment and ill treatment within as punishment. What she did as part of reconciliation is in part a masterstroke in inflicting inexplicable pain in return to her perpetrator is what made this film a winner although it will stun you into silence well after the end credits roll from the devastation the narrative left in its wake.The other half of the narrative deals with Jeanne and Simon's journey to dig through unwritten laws and reluctance of tightly knit communities that prefer to keep the status quo and not dwell and reopen wounds inflicted from their collective shameful past some in denial while others happy to have seen a more favourable outcome from Nawal's hardships. It is this piecing together of the mystery like an investigative drama that makes Incendies unique and what more Radiohead also features in the soundtrack – strange but true and very powerful if you ask me.Comparing the ratings between this film at M18 and Womb at R21 reveals what the censors allow and not allow when dealing with more mature themes likely centered around the intention of its more controversial scenes. It's anyone's guess why was was given the highest rating possible and the other one rung lower given that both actually didn't have anything explicit except perhaps one was used as an unintentional weapon of torture and destruction in the psychological sense while the other was a love story gotten out of control! Still for its strong story and excellent production values Incendies becomes that must watch film in 2011 especially during this season of noisy summer action blockbusters that absolutely don't resonate as much as this film. Highly recommended!,13 August 2011
Speechless...,"To be honest there is nothing left to say story-wise after this film. The tragedy atmosphere and everything...As an admirer of Dennis Villeneuve's filmography thanks to his work in past years I was already familiar with how much of a brilliant storyteller he is. Yet Incendies is no different. Beautifully structured script visuals soundtrack...Lastly the intro along with Radiohead's ""You and Whose Army?"" is probably the one of the best I've ever witnessed easily.",23 July 2021
"""Death is never the end of the story. It always leaves tracks.""","I don't know if I've ever seen a more heartbreaking and shocking story. Check that ""The Boy in the Striped Pajamas"" was another film that served a solid punch to the gut that remains with you a long time. I have to credit some other reviewers for this film to identify the location of the story and place it in context of the Lebanese civil war. I might have considered it myself if I hadn't been so absorbed by the story and the intricately detailed revelations regarding Nawal Marwan (Lubna Azabal) and her twins son Simon (Maxim Gaudette) and daughter Jeanne (Melissa Desormeaux-Poulin). One must pay attention though to the non-linear story telling style of director Denis Villeneuve as well as the identity of the Christian and Muslim factions involved in war time brutality and atrocity. Apart from the principal story the scene that will stay with you for a long time involves a Christian militia attack on a busload of Muslims attempting to flee their war torn and devastated city. A noble sacrifice on Marwan's part turns into a horror spectacle when a young child is gunned down by the militants. The picture exemplifies the terror of war and it's heartbreaking effect on those fortunate to survive.",5 November 2017
Top Ten Films I ever watched,This movie needs more recognition i couldn't believe it was released in 2010 it is that kind of movie which will stick until you die do watch this movie with little patience every aspect of the movie is masterpiece i.e cinematographyeditingscreenplaymusicdirectionperformance this is the only movie i consider best after the shawshank redemption and it deals with somewhat same thing i.e.hope just watch this movie and get prepared to be amazed,14 March 2019
Recommended viewing,During the reading of the will of their mother's a twin brother and sister learn of some unusual last wishes. Amongst other requests two envelopes need to be delivered to respectively the father of the two and a brother whom are both unknown. The quest leads the twins through the Middle East where they slowly learn of the horrific tales which is the life history of their late mother.The movie tells a very graphic but endearing story perfectly shot and acted allowing the viewer to get fully immersed into the journey and findings of the twins. Through flashbacks we learn about the hardship of the mother and eventually the fate of the father and brother. As a treat there is a great twist at the end which is really the icing on the cake.Highly recommended.92/100,8 February 2011
Fantastic! Villeneuve's best film yet,"This film is extraordinary on just about every level. The script is terrific the actors are perfect the direction and cinematography are all you could hope for. I recommend it without hesitation.Anyone who has seen any of Villeneuve's previous work--or Andre Turpin's Zigrail--knows that these filmmakers have bodies of work that are almost without peer in contemporary cinema world-wide and are unparallelled in the history of Canadian cinema (until seeing Incendies Maelstrom was my favourite Canadian film). Incendies does not betray that ""legacy"". You should absolutely see it.In a film as stunning as this one it's odd to single out one aspect but I must say that Lubna Azabal's performance is among the best I've ever seen. Though I've watched a few films that she's been in in the past she never really stood out for me. She is devastatingly good in this picture.I do hope that this film gets submitted to the AMPAS for Oscar selection as it is definitely the best film I've seen this year and a shoe-in for the foreign picture Oscar.My only complaint about the film was the use of music by Radiohead which took me out of the film each time it played. The rest of the music cues were spot-on and quite excellent but Thom Yorke's voice belonged nowhere near this film.",13 September 2010
The build is tense and well crafted but the twist is more shock value than adding depth to the story,There's no doubting Villeneuve's skill in building tension and emotional stakes through his characters and shots. While it's in a very different way like in Enemy the shocking twist ending doesn't really add to the story and feels forced. The difference is while in Enemy the ending was insane and left the meaning and plot completely up in the air in Incendies what happened is entirely clear and just isn't that satisfying. The most cogent point Villeneuve makes in the film is how the atrocities of war can shape people and turn them into monsters. The alternation between the past and present put into focus how war can ravage a region and a family for decades and was very effective in gradually unspooling the plot threads. The performances were all very good particularly those playing Nawal and her daughter.Now let's talk about that twist: that Nihad her first son is the man who raped her while in prison and fathered the twins. Undoubtedly it was completely unexpected. It's a pretty crazy coincidence that he was the person assigned to torture her prison and that he chooses to rape her. Putting that aside the real problem is that it doesn't add depth or explain anything about the characters or in the plot. There are no genetic problems the kids have that are explained by the incest and there was no reason for Nawal to expect that he was anything more than a random torturer - there was no inherent connection in their roles. This doesn't make the twist bad or illegitimate but also doesn't make it particularly impactful and given the intense build up to that discovery it was a letdown. Love the cinematography love the direction but nothing more than a good well-crafted movie with a forgettable ending.,7 September 2019
Probably the best drama of the last few years!,"I decided to watch this movie because I have read many excellent critics and because this book is used in Quebec's ""cegeps"" some kind of a post-high-school and my girlfriend talked about it with me. Indeed I am very happy to have seen this intense movie. It is really a great and close to perfection. Even though I have even seen one or two better films this year this movie is at least the best drama I have seen in the last five years.This movie is absolutely convincing. It has very intense images and words and has a very slow paced and sad atmosphere. The movie begins very calm but the tension raises very fast and you really feel more and more with the tragic characters. This movie makes you cry it makes you angry it shocks you. Once again it is a Quebecker movie that is cut into pieces and may mix you up a little bit in the beginning. You see scenes from the present where Jeanne and Simon are first parallely looking for the truth and trying to fulfil her last will you see scenes from the dramatic past of her mother at different stages of her life and you also see scenes from the past of her family. The movie shows not only a couple of interesting and diversified characters (played by mostly unknown and indeed extremely talented actors) but also magnificent and intense landscapes shocking crime and war scenes and insights of a foreign culture and the clash of the generations and ideologies in the past and the present. The movie is much diversified and very intellectual.Many people were surprised by several twists and a very intense and dramatic ending. It is true that the development the movie takes is really shocking but I have seen a few things coming and wasn't that surprised in the end but that almost does no harm to the atmosphere and tension of the movie. The movie tells in a very philosophical way about the irony of fate peace and war love and hate vengeance and forgiveness saints and sinners. It is uneasy to watch the movie and you still think about what you have heard and seen for quite a while after the movie.Almost everything is perfect in this movie. There are two minor reasons why I don't give the best note. First of all I was somehow able to predict some of the punches at a certain point in the movie and I have already seen more intense and shocking dramas that very even more uneasy and heavier to watch than this one for example ""The pianist"". Second some scenes in the beginning of the movie are not done very well by the camera man. In the scene where Jeanne is in her mathematic class and when she looks for some accessories in her room the camera is disturbingly shaking and moving all the time but not to create an effect of uneasiness because there are no similar scenes later in the movie during way heavier scenes. Those two scenes (that would not have been complicated to produce or film again) are just not well done and the director should have seen and corrected that before sending the final product to the festivals and cinemas. In a perfect and intense masterpiece this little detail is really something that could harm the reputation and professionalism of the whole brilliant work. The next time they should be more concentrated on the movie's perfection and keep their eyes open or invest the money in a good camera director instead of some war scenes.But all in all I think that we can really talk about an extremely good movie here! It is surely worth watching it and I agree with those ones who would like to see this movie represent Canada at the Oscars.",12 October 2010
One plus One is Equal to One,"In Canada the sixty year-old immigrant secretary Nawal Marwan (Lubna Azabal) passes away and the notary Jean Lebel (Rémy Girard) who had been her employer and friend for seventeen years reads her will to her twin son and daughter Simon (Maxim Gaudette) and Jeanne Marwan (Mélissa Désormeaux-Poulin) who is a mathematician.Nawal requests to be buried naked with her face down and her tomb without a gravestone; further she leaves three sealed envelopes addressed to the twins' father that they believed had deceased in the Middle East; to their unknown brother; and the last one to themselves to be opened only after the delivery of the other two. Then they may put a gravestone on her tomb. Simon is reluctant to respect his mother last wishes but Jeanne decides to find her biological father and brother.She travels to the Middle East to track down the past life of her mother and she discovers who she was before moving to Canada. She feels disturbed with the revelations and asks Simon to come to the Middle East to assist her in her journey. Simon discovers who his father and his brother are and concludes that one plus one may be equal to one.""Incendies"" is an intriguing film about the journey of two twin siblings that travel to the Middle East to fulfill the last wish of their mother and end discovering the disturbing history of their family.The screenplay is very well written and discloses in parallel to the journey of Jeanne first and Simon later the brave history of their mother in an unnamed country in the Middle East. The plot point in the conclusion is totally unexpected and heartbreaking. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Incêndios"" (""Fires"")",26 March 2012
A promise is very much a sacred thing,"The main attraction into seeing 'Incendies' was that it was directed by Denis Villeneuve having loved 'Sicario' and really liked 'Prisoners' (apart from the ending). Reviews for both films recommended 'Incendies' highly and with people calling it one of Villeneuve's best so seeing the film was definitely on the cards.Seeing it 'Incendies' turned out to be every bit the great film as touted. Although more needs to be seen from Villeneuve 'Incendies' to me does contain some of his best work seen thus far and my second favourite after 'Sicario'. It is a tough watch often incredibly hard-hitting and will have things that people will love and others won't (some will and have done find it contrived and melodramatic) but again to me 'Incendies' was so exceptionally well made all round with such a strong emotional impact throughout that although it is not perfect it was hard not to be hard on it.'Incendies's' weak point is the ending it is certainly unexpected and has some power but also seemed rather contrived and like it went on far with the number of coincidences almost as credibility-straining as the ending of 'Prisoners' if not quite.However 'Incendies' is superbly made visually especially in the stylish and brooding cinematography with deft use of close-ups and long shots that captures the horrors of the story wonderfully even if Roger Deakins did it just a little bit better. The scenery is similarly audacious while also highly atmospheric. The music is suitably haunting with great use of Radiohead's ""You and Whose Army"".Villeneuve's direction is some of his career's best he specialised in giving his films a darkness that was beautiful and brutal but also a hard edge that didn't hold back for the better. That can be seen in 'Incendies'. While not as tight as the script in 'Sicario' the script has a lot of emotional impact and provokes thought.When it comes to the story 'Incendies' is also hugely successful. It really hits hard without overdoing or sugar-coating things it's very much authentic and is also very moving. The bus massacre in particular is a highlight that shocks one to the core. The parallel split-time structure of the story is very interesting neither story line is hard to follow and they tie up neatly at the end while the numerous revelations and twists could have been credibility-straining and illogical if not done right but Villeneuve keeps it all under control. Anguish confusion and regret has not in a while been seen by me so poignantly on film.Performances are strong across the board with powerhouse turns from Lubna Azabal and Mélissa Désormeaux-Poulin. The film does a particularly great job in creating sympathy for the protagonist who is developed beautifully one where she is easy to root for every step of the way and comes over as a compellingly real one.Overall great film a near-masterwork though the ending is not as good as the rest of the film. 9/10 Bethany Cox",16 September 2017
Contrived motivations and director's political bias undermine Lebanese Civil War victim's compelling tale of survival,"Some viewers may regard the climax of 'Incendies' as the most effective part of the film but I must wholeheartedly disagree . If one really wants to single out the most effective and compelling scene that would be the massacre on the bus and subsequent shooting of the young child. It works because Director Denis Villenueve compounds the horror exponentially: the bus is stopped by terrorists the passengers react confused and frightened the bus driver is murdered the terrorists strafe the bus with machine gun fire killing most of the passengers Nawal (the protagonist) and a young mother and her young daughter move to the back as the terrorists pour gasoline on top of the roof of the bus Nawal escapes and takes the young girl with her only to see the terrorists set the bus on fire killing the mother and finally the child running back to the bus to be with her mother only to be shot in the back by the terrorists as Nawal watches in horror.With such an unforgettable iconic scene as listed above (along with a few others such as the 'honor killing' at the beginning of the film) why must 'Incendies' ultimately be labeled as contrived and dishonest? For starters Villenueve only vaguely alludes to the film's main setting. We know that Nawal's journey occurs in Lebanon during the Lebanese Civil War but the country along with the right wing Arab Christian party the ""Phalangists"" are never mentioned by name. When Nawal's family members murder her lover they refer to him as a ""refugee"" not as a ""Palestinian"". Despite stripping the events depicted in the film of their political context Villenueve clearly cannot hide his bias. Nawal decides to become an assassin for the Muslims after her Muslim lover is murdered by her own Christian family and she's a witness to the bus massacre by Arab Christian terrorists. Only a ""kindly"" Muslim warlord (""Chamseddine"") happens to tell Narwan's son Simon the truth during the search for the ""son"" and the ""father"". And that truth is that the fighting is tit for tat—one reprisal begets another. Nonetheless Villenueve still implies that it's the Muslim side who are clearly the wronged party here. By no means am I trying to defend the brutality of the right-wing nationalists during the Lebanese Civil War but there were two sides to the story and certainly that's lost in Villenueve's narrative.As to why the film should be considered contrived it's not so much the wacko ending which is designed to point out the horrors of war (and hence its pointlessness) but the whole idea that the mother would send her children on a wild goose chase making them face the truth about HER situation instead of telling them what happened on her deathbed (she was able to blurt out the main points to family friend the Notary Lebel) or allowing Lebel to explain it to the kids without having them experience the full impact of the horror by traveling to Lebanon dredging up old wounds amongst people who they didn't know (and didn't even speak their language). I question whether any mother would have put her children in such a position—why was she so insistent on having them learn the truth about their parentage? After all the revelation that her son was actually her other children's father basically drove her insane and led to her death. This from a woman who always claimed she would do anything for her children. And here they would end up in a foreign country asking sensitive questions which could place their lives in jeopardy.While a series of chilling events clearly molded Narwan's character there's little character development when it comes to the son. He has that most disagreeable chip on his shoulder (until he finally bonds with his sister in the swimming pool) but for most of the film he is an unwelcome one-note presence. And what's with that lack of hesitation with taking a ride blind-folded with the Warlord's bodyguards? The guide's assurance that ""everything is okay"" is enough for him to take a ride with a duo of potential killers. How does he know that his guide can be so sure about the Warlord?And what about Abou Tarek (the 'son' and the 'father')? The Warlord trains him to be a crackerjack sniper but becomes disaffected by war and switches sides ending up in the Christian Arab prison as Narwan's torturer. Even though we hear the explanation from Chamseddine it seems a little too convenient that Tarek so easily switches from the Muslim to the Christian Arab side with so little explanation. Of course without him doing so there's no 'twist ending' designed to shock.I understood that the two letters which Narwan has her children deliver to Tarek reflects Narwan's ambivalence about how she feels toward him. But again why involve the twins? How is Narwan so sure that her revelation to him that he's her son will impact his conscience? It's already been established that he's a psychopath so I would hardly think that he would care who his mother is. For all we know Tarek may have decided to go after the half-siblings as they could reveal his dark secret publicly and cause him a good deal of trouble.'Incendies' manages to keep one's interest despite the main character's motivations that don't add up and the director's clear political bias. It's worth seeing but hardly deserves the accolades that have been heaped upon it since its heralded release.",20 November 2011
Seeing the end in 1 hour and 15 minutes is like a jigsaw suddenly clear,Seeing the end in 1 hour and 15 minutes is like a jigsaw suddenly clear. It is difficult to agree with the mother's motivation setting. True love is silence and commitment swallowing and digesting alone. It is my suffering that is settled and cut off by me today. I will never force a pair of children to embark on the journey of inheriting pain and cocoon. If the director tells his mother to hide the truth and passes away with a secret and the children actively pursue the answer the ending will be even more shocking.,18 May 2020
I wish I didn't watch this movie,This movie is great but believe me you don't want to watch this movie my life will not be the same again,20 April 2020
Here is what really really bothers me,Here is what really bothers me: On her grave stone it states that she was born in 1949 and died in 2009.Now and I am giving the script every chance let's say she is very young when she has the first son. The actress is 37 at the time but let's say 16 nevertheless.That means we've now reached 1965.The twins are played by 29 and 36 year-olds. Let's make them both 29 (even though the female twin mentions '35 years ago' when talking about her mother in the old country) That means they were born in 1980 and conceived in 1979 - when their brother/father was 14. AND mind you he was a deadly sniper for 4 years prior to coming to the prison - plus what ever time it took for him to remade from an Islamic sniper to a Christian expert in torture.So a 10 year old super sniper?You get my drift here?The ridiculous coincidences at the end of the movie is a whole other matter of contention...,22 February 2022
Exquisite,Denis Villeneuve has created nothing less than a masterpiece. This film is revealing a great Director especially when given an original story with such powerful dimensions.Despite being skeptical as first of the film being shot in Jordan when dealing with the very specific multidimensional Lebanese drama the geographic distance with the land of Lebanon is detaching the film from the strict reality of the place and taking it to whole other level of significance. Jordan's landscape especially with the film's photography are somewhat surrealistic as if the story was taking place in a deep level of the region's sub-conscious.Villeneuve has managed to delicately craft a story with dimensions that a human mind in its normal condition is not prepared to understand and confront. And yet these things did happen many times during the war and retelling them is a very not an easy task. Actually a quasi impossible one and yet Villeneuve did it.This has to be the film representing Canada at the Oscars. And it will win.,21 September 2010
Don't miss this masterpiece,How stupid iam to postpone this movie for 6 months watching all other stuff.... I've underrated this movie watching trailer 😑,14 May 2020
Incendies,Incendies is based on the play by Wajdi Mouawad. The film is a Canadian film in French and Arabic with English subtitles. Going into the theatre to see Incendies I really knew nothing about it. I had not read any of the reviews that came out but I had heard from the television news shows that it was supposed to be very good and now with a Best Foreign Language Film Oscar I assumed that it was going to be a really good film. I decided not to read anything about the plot before I saw the film because these days I find that so many critics gave away too much crucial information of the films in their reviews that when you finally do see the film it does not have the same affect on you. So having known nothing about Incendies and then watching the story unfold before my eyes was quite an experience and I would recommend you do the same if you are at all inclined to go see it. Other than the film's director Denis Villeneuve I was not familiar with anybody else who appeared in the film or worked on the sides but I must say that they all did a fantastic job. This is the type of film that when you are watching it you are not quite sure what will happen or how the climax or the ending will come but when it does it makes sense to you and leaves you with a multitude of feelings. At times Incendies was not always the most easy film to watch not because it was overly violent or graphic because I thought everything was handled in a very tastefully done way but it still sucks so much emotion out of us and we get to care so much for the characters and what they are going through as we watch it before our eyes that we can not help but feel sad enraged or even physically ill watching it at times. I should clarify that the film does deal with some of the goings on with the Middle East and the wars tension and prejudices that came out of some of those wars and moments of terror that people at that time and still are going through. I also liked how when dealing with such a tricky and controversial subject matter such as this that as I mentioned it was all very tastefully done and none of it felt like you were watching a Hollywood movie. I think if this had been a big budget big name star movie extravaganza then it probably would not have worked. The reason it works so well as it is is because the fact that it is so character driven and deals with events that have gone on in the past and in some similar and different ways are still going on today. The film felt personal to me. It felt like the people involved with the film had something to say and instead of sugar coating everything and making it an easily watchable film with a feel good portion of it it instead goes for all your emotions and in a sense almost takes you on the journey and the personal trials and tribulations that the characters in the movie have gone on and understandably we can almost feel their pain exhaustion and hurt because the performances have this sense of believability and authenticity to them that everything we see them go through feels like the real thing and the way they handle each situation is believable and not far fetched at all. The characters in the film give us something to believe in because they are searching for the truth and will go to many lengths to find it even if at times it is difficult or even dangerous and the amount of honour and pride they carry with them to set out someone's wishes is truly remarkable. This is an incredibly powerful film that as I mentioned does put you through an array of different emotions but I did not mind that because I felt I could connect with the characters more because of this. The look and feel of the film is not big budget or fake looking which makes all the interior and exterior shots look real and further enhancing the emotions or moods we are supposed to feel in each scene. The acting by everyone involved is all terrific here as well and this is just a really well put together film with a great cast and director and wonderful material to work and mold into this brave haunting and yet life changing experience. I have not seen any of the other Best Foreign Language Film Oscar nominees but having just seen Incendies now I would say that it has a good chance of winning because of how masterful and great it is. Do not just take my word for it go and see it when it opens in a theatre near you. This is certainly one of the best films of 2010.,10 February 2011
Very Good Until Becoming Too Contrived,"""Incendies"" is one of these movies that really disappoints - The ones that for a good portion of the movie are highly enthralling but then comes crashing down. (Major Spoiler) I had an inkling that the filmmakers might pull what they ended up trying to smear on the viewer and it was so so disappointing. Suffice it to say to twist the plot around and pretzel it like they did the filmmakers stooped to utter contrivance. They blew up logic and believability for the sake of sensationalism. How probable could all of this actually take place in such a sequence (?) quite improbable. Additionally I had a hard time understanding what exactly transformed the mother into a killer(?) The ending became marginal and a continuation of the contrivance. Too bad - it had a great story going up until the last quarter of it's run-time.",8 October 2011

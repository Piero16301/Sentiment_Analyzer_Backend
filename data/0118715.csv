The film with the highest rewatchability factor of all time,"It's actually kind of hard to describe this movie (and what's so great about it) to people who don't already know it and love it; as with many cult films The Big Lebowski will either speak to you (in which case you will become a fervent follower of His Dudeness and abide by his code for the rest of your life) or if it doesn't the film will either leave you completely indifferent or you'll even downright hate it.I believe it's a very funny film and I'm sure it can be rightfully called a comedy but don't expect punchlines gags jokes or slapstick - it's not that kind of comedy. If you want to enjoy this film you have to meet Jeffery ""The Dude"" Lebowski on his terms hang out with him and his bowling buddies and follow them at a their (perhaps somewhat leisurely) pace through this weird and unbelievable tale about nihilism theft (of a car and more importantly: a Creedence Clearwater Revival tape) kidnapping abstract art porn and - of course - bowling. The story is actually kind of simple. You see some no-good German nihilists urinated on The Dude's rug - and this kind of aggression just won't stand against The Dude. With the help of his bowling buddies he will do everything in his power to get someone to pay for his rug - or possibly get a new one (because that rug really tied the room together). So he embarks on this worthy quest during which he will encounter many wondrous things and fascinating people (even Jesus - who is NOT the messiah but a very naughty man).With Jeff Bridges in the leading role the Coen brothers have found the perfect actor to incorporate one of the most iconic characters that has ever been created. But it's not just The Dude that makes this a winner; the whole film is such an inspired folly and simply inventive filmmaking at its finest (the hilarious dream sequence alone is worth the price of admission). The supporting cast is outstanding (J.Turturro J.Goodman and S.Buscemi among many others) the song choices are perfect and the dialog is the funniest most quotable in any comedy I've ever seen. This - for me - is without a doubt the film with the highest rewatchability factor of all time. 10 stars out of 10.Favorite Films: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054200841/Lesser-known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite Low-Budget and B-movies: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054808375/",3 November 2015
The Most Quotable Film of All Time,"Those Coen brothers have an ear for language. You feel it in the sing-songy banalities of Fargo and in the noiresque machine-gun dialogue of Miller's Crossing but neither of these can prepare you for the feast for the ears that is The Big Lebowski.Channeling the opaque mysteries of Raymond Chandler the Coens throw LA resident bum and Bowling aficionado Jeff Lebowski (""The Dude"" to his friends) into a strange triple-crossing case of kidnapping ransoms nihilists and urinated-upon rugs. It is the equivalent of throwing unrelenting forces at an immovable object the Dude's bemused stoicism at constant odds with the world around him. He'd much rather be bowling with crazed Vietnam Vet Walter (John Goodman) and pure silent soul Donnie (Steve Buscemi).As with so much of the Coens' output style is more than half the point: not just visual though ace DP Roger Deakins paints an alluring canvas but tonal and auditory. This is an insanely funny head-trip of a movie with wonderfully idiosyncratic characters down to the smallest part. Who better than the Coens to reinvent the comedy of errors?This is without a doubt one of their very best a personal favorite an unmissable film and the kind of experience that will plant an indelible smile on your face. Do yourself and see this now if you haven't already.",5 December 2002
My favourite Coen brothers movie and one of the most entertaining and original comedies ever made!,"My favourite Coen brothers movie changes over the years as I watch and rewatch their amazingly original and consistently surprising oeuvre. When I first saw 'The Big Lebowski' on its original release I enjoyed it but thought it was a bit of a slight ""fun"" movie with less depth than many of their previous works. Now a few years and several viewing later I have come to realise just how accomplished a movie it is and it has become one of my all time favourite movies. Other film makers have attempted to weave together various genres styles and images in a similarly eclectic postmodern fashion but few do it as seamlessly and with such wit as Ethan and Joel Coen. 'The Big Lewboski' is an extremely smart film but it doesn't shout ""look at me! Aren't I clever?"". It sucks you in from the get go and bottom line it is FUNNY and as it is a comedy that's what counts the most! Everything about the movie is perfect the script the direction set design costumes and the wonderful soundtrack (one of the most brilliant ever assembled it includes lesser known Dylan and Elvis Costello numbers Creedence classics and songs from cult favourites like Yma Sumac Captain Beefheart Moondog Esquivel and garage gods The Monks). Plus of course the actors who are well cast and virtually flawless. Jeff Bridges ('Fat City' 'Starman') IS The Dude and it's impossible to think of anyone else acting the role. Coen regulars John Goodman Steve Buscemi John Turturro Peter Stomare and Jon Polito are all on board as well as Julianne Moore ('Boogie Nights') David Huddleston ('Capricorn One') Philip Seymour Hoffman ('Magnolia') and Sam Elliot ('Mask') even surprise cameos from Ben Gazzara ('The Killing Of A Chinese Bookie') and singer Jimmie Ray Gilmore. I can't fault 'The Big Lebowski' it is one of the most original and entertaining comedies ever made and a genuine modern classic. It's movies like this that keep me watching despite the endless mountain of mindless garbage that Hollywood continually spews out. If only every movie in the box office Top Ten was as inspired and amusing as this one!",27 December 2002
Simply Beautiful,It's a travesty that most critics only read The Big Lebowski at its most superficial level and called it a modern take on a Raymond Chandler potboiler. I simply can't begin to perceive how one could sit down in front of this cinematic pop-poetry as it plates gold on the silver screen and not feel so incredibly alive. The dream sequence Busbee Berkley musical numbers are unique and awe-inspiring; the humor is rich subtle and clever in the way it satirizes politically correct arrogance; the free-flowing story avoids (even pokes fun at) nonessentials like plot points and pay-offs. But what really makes this film such a masterpiece such a panacea is the incredible humanism the care that the Coen brothers put in developing The Dude (Jeff Bridges) Walter (John Goodman) Donnie (Steve Buscemi-tremendously endearing) and Brandt (magnificently played by Phillip Seymour Hoffman). Looking at the films use of Sam Elliott to play The Stranger who constantly rambles about the many wonders of The Dude (among other things) it is clear that the film is an ode to a Dudist way of life. And in a time where so many film promise that they have the answer to the worlds problems and end up as slick stylistic show-off films what more could one ask for than a good-hearted film like this? Not to mention the performance by Jeff Bridges which ranks among the best performances of the nineties; he has a relaxed slouch a goofy smile an enthusiastic dance and his buttons can only be pushed by Walter who John Goodman plays with charm and fury. The Coen brothers have always been considered 'cold' filmmakers but there is nothing here but warmth and humanity (as is the case with the Coens' Fargo). What we have here is one of the greatest achievements in modern cinema and if you can't see that grab a White Russian hit the bowling ally and find your inner-Dude as soon as possible.,16 October 2004
indeed a cult classic,More than 20 years it took me to have a look at this cult classic. Finally did it and I do undestand the fuss about it.Not a flick for everybody that I can tell because a lot of talking is done but it's the talking that starts to get funny after a while. In fact a bunch of loser trying to solve a abduction and trying to hold the money for themselves goes terribly wrong.After a while you even want the talking to go on and on. And some art flick here and there it was indeed a hell of a ride funny stupid but genious in its kind.Gore 0/5 Nudity 1/5 Effects 3/5 Story 4/5 comedy 2/5.,12 April 2021
The Dude Abides...!,My Rating : 9/10You either hate it or love it. I am in love with 'The Big Lebowski'! I love most of the Coen Brothers' work and this one is right up there with Fargo and No Country For Old Men. It's super funny and can be watched again and again. I think I watch it once a year and always have a great time.One that I highly recommend. Go watch it! And then watch it again and again.AN AWESOME CULT FILM.,24 October 2018
A wonderful film...with the word f#@$ used 102030841 times!,I tried watching this film on TV a few years ago but I made the mistake of doing so with my kids nearby. In the first 10 minutes of so I heard 'f#@$' (a word you are NOT allowed to use even once on IMDb) dozens of times. Realizing that the film was NOT family-friendly I turned it off despite all the very positive reviews I'd read for it. However considering I've seen all the Coen Brothers films except this one I knew that eventually I'd get back to seeing it. Nearly a decade has passed and I finally got around to seeing this cult favorite.Considering that there are nearing 1000 reviews for this film I won't bother discussing the plot--it's been explained to death. Besides the plot believe it or not is not all that important. As a mystery film the mystery is figured out early in the film. So despite this why is the film so good--good enough that I gave it a 9 and many consider it their favorite film ever? Well the Coen Brothers' bizarre and surreal style really make this film and off the top of my head I can only think of two of their films I liked better THE HUDSUCKER PROXY (their most underrated film) and OH BROTHER WHERE ART THOU? (their film that gets better with each viewing). This is very good company as these two other films are absolutely brilliant--and I consider THE BIG LEBOWSKI to be much more interesting that the much ballyhooed FARGO (which inexplicably won two Oscars--despite not being among the brothers' best films because it's way too normal--sort of like a Coen Brothers film for those who don't get the more bizarre Coen Brothers films).What in particular did I like? Well the characters were THE best part of the film--as only the Coens can create such quirky and unique characters. Simply put there is no one like Lebowski in any of the thousands and thousands of films I'd seen before--and uniqueness is something I value most in a film. The alcoholic lazy and hopelessly pathetic guy is like no hero you'll ever see in a film! The usual quirky characters are here as well--in spades! What I also loved were the little movies within the movie. When Lebowski got knocked out you got to see his bizarre dreams that were more like films than dreams--particularly the one later in the film that just killed me it was so funny and stylish. Believe it or not the dream is a phallic-filled song and dance film...directed by a famous porno director (though without actual nudity). It just has to be seen to be believed and only HUDSUCKER PROXY had stranger and more entertaining interludes. In fact I found myself laughing out loud at this great scene...and a few more.Overall a highly imaginative and wonderfully quirky film with very little plot and gobs of cursing. NOT family-friendly or a film to show your mother (unless you DO want to give her a heart attack) but still well worth seeing. Oh and by the way the version often shown on TV recently is an edited version with many of the expletives removed. The original actors provided alternative words for the f-bomb and it's done reasonably seamlessly. Frankly I don't think it hurts the film and you still get to hear words like penis which have not been changed.,28 January 2010
The Dude Abides!!!,"No movie has entertained me more in the last year than this film. It's delightfully written directed with poise and acted with extravagance and excellence. I do admit that this is a film that I had to see six times to get. Every time I watch it I learn something new. The genius of the film lies within a game I think the Coen brothers play with their audiences. There are the touches of the masters in many of their films. In ""The Hudsucker Proxy"" it was Preston Sturges and Frank Capra. In ""Raising Arizona"" I felt a touch of Sam Fuller. In this film I felt many touches of greatness but more specifically I felt John Sayles or even John Cassevettes in spots. The camera was manipulated beautifully and I felt a tinge of their talents lurking in at many a turn. The performances are astounding especially Goodman as the deranged bowler still living deep within the jungles of the Vietcong. Huddleston is also quite wonderful as the title character. Turturro gives a fine cameo as ""Jesus"" coupled with a rousing and humurous version of the Eagles ""Hotel California"" done in Espanol. I hope this is a film that is looked at with more seriousness. It is once you dig deep a fine piece of filmmaking.",24 February 1999
"It's good knowin' he's out there. The Dude. Takin' 'er easy for all us sinners.""","Looks like while making ""The Big Lebowski"" (1998)– weird nutty outrageously funny and deliciously twisted movie the brothers Ethan and Joel Coens known for their unique and dry humor sat back laughed out loud and had fun. ""Big Lebowski"" turned as one of the funniest comedies ever made. It is funny because of the incredibly off-beat characters their weirdness flaws their interactions the surreal situations they found themselves in and perfectly written and delivered hilarious dialogs. There is the story of course which is based on the case of mistaken identity with the following kidnapping villainous nihilists vanguard erotic flying painter the bowler named Jesus but the story is truly secondary to the delicious craziness of the movie.Some reviewers call Big Lebowski misfire and deranged mess saying that the story is convoluted with the characters we would not care about a bit. It was also interesting to read the reviews that were written upon its release and compared it to Coens' ""Fargo"" that had been made a year earlier than the adventure of Jeffrey ""the Dude"" Lebowski (Jeff Bridges).""Fargo"" could be Coens' masterwork but it does not make Lebowski any worse. It was dismissed as the inferior film and was predicted not to stand the future re-watch. The time has proved the predictions wrong. ""The Dude"" Lebowski - middle-aged pot smoking White Russian drinking bowling enthusiast ex-hippie and his friends Polish Catholic converted Jew ""more Jewish than Tevye"" Vietnam veteran Walter with anger management problems (John Goodman) and timid little slow ""sweet prince"" Donny (unusually quiet Steve Buscemi) have become the cult figures the beloved characters for millions of film lovers of different generations not only the baby- boomers.The Coen Brothers have made twenty films and all of them are treasure including their contribution in the 2006 anthology Paris je t'aime. I've seen all their films and I want to repeat the title of my review on their latest ""Burn after reading"" - The Coen Brothers don't make bad movies because they don't know how. Their films Including the cult favorite Big Lebowski should not be missed. They are clever darkly funny and beautiful without being pretty pictures. In short they are first class entertainment.",4 January 2015
I just don't get it.,"TBL is not a terrible movie but I apparently just don't get it. My lady-friend's daughter is always telling her that she should see TBL in order to understand some of the ""in-humor"" and comments of her generation. I kept telling my friend that I really didn't think that the movie would be what she expected but we watched it together anyway. (I had already seen it a couple times.) My friend was flabbergasted as she couldn't identify any phrases humorous scenes or references that she had ever heard or seen her daughter's group use. She didn't like the movie either and was actually checking to make sure that it was the same movie her daughter had recommended.I feel the same way. Frankly this movie is boring and pretentious. I love most of the Coens' work but not this film. It goes into a category along with ""Young Frankenstein"" of movies about which other people make a fuss and I just don't get. Maybe I'm slow.Anyway if your idea of fun is watching a laid-back dude drink White Russians and a lot of unnecessary one-dimensional characters get layered on go ahead. It's just not my cup of tea.",9 March 2009
You can watch it a million times and yet it will never get old,"The Big Lebowski is the type of movie that is so funny and so clever you want nothing more but to meet the Coen brothers congratulate them personally for their unique talent and get inside their heads and find out what makes these two geniuses ""tick"". The main characters are Jeff Bridges (who plays such broad roles like The Muse The Contender and Sea Biscuit) John Goodman (who should have won an oscar for best supporting actor for his character Walter Sobchak)Juliane Moore (Maude Lebowski)and Steve Buscemi (who is unique in every Coen Brother movie).The first time I saw this movie I will admit that I enjoyed it but did not fully appreciate its level of humor and raw talent. I thought the middle section was a bit too depressing and long. But trust me this is a movie that gets more funny every time you see it even if it's your thousandth time seeing it. Its level of comedy action brutality and vulgarity become that much more evident and important.The characters are brilliantly written by the coen brothers and likewise are brilliantly portrayed by the actors. The Big Lebowski is like no other film. It will make you laugh and it will make you cry. There is no other film such as TBL that is sharp and witty all the way through. One of the Joel and Ethan Coen's best and one of the movie industry's best comedic film of all time. You want to go see this flick.",28 March 2004
The Deadbeat Lebowski,"How can anyone not dig The Dude? In a world where energetic go-getters are idolised and looked up to it's nice to know that there are fat indolent scruffy pot smoking beer drinking bums out there taking it easy. Or they would be if people would leave their rugs alone The Big Lebowski is a film where the plot is entirely inconsequential; it doesn't matter. It's just a mere device to set The Dude on his way. The joy is in watching him interact with all the weirdos in Los Angeles and in listening to the dialogue  the script is the most quotable since Withnail and I. Therefore it's the perfect film to just sit back and absorb.Picking a favourite scene in a film that is jam packed with great moments and wonderful lines of dialogue is a near impossibility but you'd be hard pressed to beat the scene with the Malibu police chief. ""I don't like your jerk-off name. I don't like your jerk-off face. I don't like your jerk-off behaviour. And I don't like youjerk-off."" And then to cap it off he throws his mug at The Dude's head. Brilliant! And making it even funnier is the scene that immediately follows it where the taxi driver throws The Dude out of his cab.But another favourite is Jesus. He only has two scenes but both are hilarious. (I hope the Coens make 'The Passion of the Jesus.') And I love the flashback where you see him knocking on doors to tell his neighbours that he's a pederast. Especially good is the way that a large bearded man with a dirty shirt answers the door (I always crack up at the breath Jesus takes when he sees the man  I also noticed for the first time that Jesus in that flashback is visibly showing in his tight jeans; he's not a small guy).But then there's the scene where The Dude first meets Maude Lebowski (excellently played by Julianne Moore). ""I'm sorry if your stepmother is a nympho but"" And I also like the little dig at the porno film they're watching: ""The plot is ludicrous."" But the comment isn't really aimed at the porno film; the film is talking about itself. It knows the plot is nonsensical but it also knows that it doesn't matter  it's best to just let it wash over you.Mentioning porno has reminded me of Jackie Treehorn. Is there a better visual gag in modern cinema than The Dude scratching a notepad for a message or telephone number only to find a cartoon of a man with a gigantic erection? Well maybe there is because even earlier in the film there's the moment where The Dude spends a long time making a homemade device to keep intruders out only for him to forget the fact that his door opens outwards instead of inwards  he nails a bit of wood to the floor props a chair up to the door handle to keep people out and the very second he walks away the door opens and the chair comes tumbling down. Pure genius! And Jackie Treehorn's brainless goons are brilliant too. ""You're not dealing with morons here."" Oh yes we are. But the film's all the better for it.But I'm not sure what my favourite line in the film would be  again it's almost impossible to pick just one. But ""I still jerk-off manually"" would have to be up there as would virtually every line Walter spews (""The Chinaman is not the issue""). However if I was forced (at gunpoint) to choose I'd have to go with a piece of Dude wisdom: ""Fortunately I'm adhering to a pretty strict uh drug regiment to keep my mind you know uh limber."" And The Dude's reaction when Maude tells him that she's trying to conceive is magnificent.Yet another brilliant scene is the Larry scene. Walter and The Dude are trying to get information out of some kid but the kid just stares impassively at them so Walter destroys his car  or what he thinks is his car. Now at this moment I could quote the real dialogue but the TV version dialogue is perhaps even better. ""Do you see what happens Larry? Do you see what happens when you find a stranger in the Alps?"" It's even better than: ""Fun you melon farmer!"" Then there are the nihilists. ""We believe in nothing Lebowski. Nothing. And tomorrow we come back and we cut off your johnson."" But try as they might to intimidate the only scary thing about the nihilists is the techno music they listen to. Well that and their obsession with the male member.But I could quote lines from The Big Lewbowski all day. I just dig the film so much because it puts a goofy grin on my face; its stupidity is remarkably intelligent. Plus in the end it's actually quite heartfelt  if the film's about anything it's about friendshipwell that and smoking pot drinking beer bowling and keeping hold of your johnson. Yeah the world's a better place with The Dude in it.",5 October 2005
Coen film with thrills  emotion  musical numbers and humor with tongue-in-cheek,"The Big Lebowskiv(1998) is an enjoyable film by Coen Brothers that packs thrills  dry humor  action  wonderful songs and numerous cinematic references . Jeff Lebowski (Jeff Bridges) is a stuck-in-the-70s stoner who insists on being called The Dude and loves to go bowling . He suffers a beating at the hands of thugs who are after money owed by a snutty wife who ruined some debt collectors. Being wrongly mistaken for a millionaire (David Huddleston) and along the way Jeff attempts to be compensated for his spoiled rug . While enlisting his bowling buddies (craxed irascible John Goodman and nice Steve Buscemi) for help while trying to find the millionaire's missing wife (Tara Reid). They figured he was a lazy time-wasting slacker !. They were right !. Her life was in their hands. Now her toe is in the mail !. Times like these call for a Big Lebowski !. It takes guys as simple as the Dude and Walter to make a story this complicated... and they'd really rather be bowling. Lebowski: Not a man a way of life !An amusing and funny film in which our starring is drawn into kidnapping  attempted scamming of payoff money and more bowling . Starred by some rare characters suffering several Coanesque adventures ; what the protagonists encounter along the way are a number of surprising situations and weird roles that  when all is said and done  seem like just that individual incidents that never really add up to a whole plot . While this may seem like plot-a-plenty  it's mainly a showcase for the Cohen brothers' unique texturing of style and quirky but deep roles . Includes the Cohen's pithy dialogue  it looks and sounds marvellous . The film may not have the enigmatic elegance or emotional resonance of Barton Fink or Fargo  but it is still a prime example of the Cohen's efoortless brand of stylistic and sstorytelling brilliance . The highlight showcase is a stunning musical-bowling-fantasy sequence that would have made Busby Berkely proud . Main and support cast are pretty good . Jeff Bridges gives a sympathetic acting as the ultimate L. A. slacker Jeff ""The Dude"" Lebowski  mistaken for a millionaire of the same name and seeking restitution for a rug. Co-stars John Goodman as a fun and loud Vietnam vet who takes any opportunity into grossy obscenities. David Huddleston as the wheel-chair-bound millionare of the same name who assigns him to recover his sluttty wife performed by Tara Reid . While John Turturro steal the show as a pervert rival bowler who loves skintight lilac jumpsuits and polishing his ball.Thanks to Roger Deakin's gleaming camerawork the film expand a colorful and luminous cinematography . T-Bone eccletic selection soundtrack and agreeable score by Carter Burwell . This fun and entertainining motion picture was well written and directed by Joel and Ethan Coen . They have shared these duties on all of their films but Joel has always been listed as director and Ethan as producer . The first Coen brothers film where both he and brother Ethan Coen are given directing and producing credits was Ladykillers (2004). Both of whom are part of the prestigious group of individuals to have won Oscars for writing  directing and producing in the same year for the film No Country for Old Men (2007). Their career is splendid from first film : Blood simple (1984) to Arizona Baby (1987) Miller's crossing (1990)  Oh Brother ! (2000) Barton Fink (1991) the great Lebowski (1998) The Man Who Wasn't There (2001)  Intolerable Cruelty (2003)  Burn After Reading (2008)  A Serious Man (2009)  True grit (2010) among others . Rating : 7/10. Well worth watching  better than average. The flick will appeal to Jeff Bridges fans and Joel/Ethan Coen followers.",2 December 2022
The Big Bust,"I recently saw an interview with Jeff Bridges where he commented that he has become personally identified with ""The Dude"" the character he plays in this movie. He also noted that ""The Big Lebowski"" has developed a cult following. The interviewer added some praise. That together with the high rating on IMDb convinced me to give this a shot. Early on I realized that the story was not to be taken seriously. This movie is a series of loosely connected comedy sketches (well some hardly connected at all). The result is an absurdest comedy that had very few laughs for me.I did not find The Dude at all appealing as a person. How much is there to admire in someone whose life goals seem to be bowling and drinking white Russians? I do give Bridges credit for inhabiting the role. John Goodman's character really grated on me--his passions seem to be bowling and the f word. The positives: the scenes with John Turturro gave me some laughs; the scenes filmed from within a bowling ball were an interesting curiosity; some non sequiturs were worth a few chuckles.I guess one person's humor is another person's tedium. I found this movie to be tedious.",1 May 2013
A Perfect Strike !,"Recently given a one night cinematic return to mark 20 years since its initial release. ""The Big Lebowski"" remains on the highpoints of the Coen Brothers remarkable career of excellence. Their farcical homage to Raymond Chandler stars Jeff Bridges as ""The Dude"" whose real name Jeff Lebowski drags him into a plot to ransom the wife of his namesake played by David Huddleston. Blackmailers come to the wrong address rugs are pissed on and threats are made. Eventually the ""Big"" Lebowski chooses ""The Dude"" to be the bag man for the ransom drop off. A decision that all involved soon come to regret. Twenty years has allowed me to watch ""The Big Lebowski"" a few times and to be fair it's a film that improves with each watch. The plot is nothing special in fact it's almost non-existant. The character revolve around each other and at the end of it you're no wiser as to who if anyone actually kidnapped Bunny (Tara Reid) or what happened to the $1M dollars. . But you come to appreciate that the plot isn't as important as the characters and what characters they are. Jeff Bridges gives a career best performance as ""The Dude"".... Mumbling and ""man-ing"" his way through the film which belies the wit that he sometimes allows a glimpse of. It is one of the funniest most quotable movies of all time. Full of the Coen's regular acting troop some of whom show up for just one or two scenes make their memorable mark and then are never heard from again. It is a stone cold classic and we'll still be watching it in another twenty years.",25 September 2018
Characters Plot Dialogue...,... roll them into a smoke and ignite if these necessary constituents of any great film burn bright take a long deep draw and savour their infusion. This original unique and superbly performed film does just that - something to be relished and luxuriate within while allowing you to put life's irritants into perspective.,21 October 2020
Pederasts nihilists and rugs,"Sounds like a Three Stooges short no? But wait and see: ""The Big Lebowski"" is an American 2-hour film from 1998 so this one will have its 20th anniversary next year. It is of course by the Oscar-winning Coen Brothers and even without gigantic awards attention this is definitely a contender for their most known as it has turned into a real cult classic over the years. This is also thanks to the cast not just to the script. There are three performers in here who won acting Oscars later in their careers namely the late Philip Seymour Hoffman Julianne Moore and of course Jeff Bridges who plays the central character in here and who is really good at it even if I might give the edge to John Goodman (Argo Roseanne) here in terms of who I'd pick as the film's MVP. But there's also people in here that you would not necessarily expect like Tara Reid or RHCP's Flea. And then there's Coen regulars like Stormare Buscemi (both Fargo) and Turturro (Barton Fink). A lot of fun for sure. The Coens once again succeed in writing even the minor characters in a way where they stay in mind thanks to their mannerisms and behavioral patterns. Very well done and this tendency has elevated many Coen films. And as absurd as these characters may occasionally seem there is still something authentic to them. You never get the impression that you are actually watching actors in roles here but they feel like actual people. Of course on the other hand not everything is perfect with this movie. The scenes with Julianne Moore didn't do too much for me especially her early scenes. Sam Elliott I also could have done without. I like his narration voice that would have been enough although his conversation with Bridges' character was also fine in the middle of the film and how they talk about cowboy looks profanity etc. But with him saying the final words the film did not exactly close at its best I suppose. Also kinda feel he has a tendency to always play the same character and it seems that back then he looked exactly the way he looks today. But for every negative criticism I have there are at least five positive things for me to say about this film. The best example is really everything involving John Goodman. His scene with the gun was a riot only the Coens can depict an actually dangerous situation in a manner as hilarious and entertaining as they did here. His scene in the car when they are about to give the money to the abductors is even better and how he keeps talking about beating the crap out of them. And it's no empty words either as we find out eventually when he runs indeed into the three German nihilists. Poor Buscemi's character. Or again about Goodman his recurring words directed at Buscemi's character. Or how he keeps mentioning Vietnam to show how tough he is. And if we are talking about recurring references already Bridges' character has his own too of course such as how he keeps ordering the same drink even if they may not be as good as Goodman's. The dialogue writing is top-notch here for sure and even if this is always the case with the Coens and their films we should not take it for granted. Too many examples. One that stayed in the mind for me is the ""let me take another look"" (or something like that) when the bad guys keep pushing his head inside the toilet early on. What a cool dude. No pun intended.As a result we get many hilarious scenes like at the bowling alley early on (e.g. the gun scene) or also all the scenes with the Dude and Lebowski. I had to laugh so hard at some of these. Yes the film maybe got a bit worse in the second half and maybe the story took two or three plot twists and roads that may have been too absurd but at this point it doesn't really matter anymore as you are truly sucked in by the entertainment. It's also not a film where you really wonder what will happen to the protagonists or care about them deeply. Instead you just enjoy the moment and what is happening to them this very instant. Good acting strong writing hilarious scenes that turn the eventual outcome into one of the very best of 1998 especially in the first 60 minutes. So of course I give it four stars out of five. I (highly) recommend checking it out if you are one of the very few who have not yet seen it. Also a must-see for bowling lovers. And as for the Coens' quality just pick Tara Reid whose career has gone down the drain considerably but so talented people like the duo of writers and directors here effortlessly install her in a movie that has turned into a classic without any bad impact at all. Admittedly this is also because of her looks of course because really she does not have a lot to put on display in terms of range and versatility. She has that conversation with the Dude early on at the mansion and finally we see her in the car and that's it but maybe this lack of a challenge was why they picked her. I immediately had to think of another character in an early Tarantino movie. I am sure you know who I am talking about. Anyway let's not drift away from this one as there is a lot more to say here. For example I mentioned the scene in the car. This was one example of how effortless good the Coens are when it comes to storytelling. We find out that indeed she was never kidnapped. We also see she still has all her toes and we see where the actually severed toe came from in another scene in a bar (poor girl!) and this is also pretty unique how the Coens are so strong in depicting somewhat violent moments in comedic light which always feels pretty unique with them. The only one who does it at least almost as good is again the aforementioned Tarantino. But while he was my favorite earlier and I still like him a lot I am 100% Team Coen Bros now because honestly it feels as if I love each and every single film they made. This one here is no exception. It took me until 2017 to watch it for the first time and it was already really good there but now in 2020 I got the chance to watch it again for the first time on the big screen of an open air cinema and this was when I really fell in love with this movie. Okay that is maybe a bit too much to say but I liked it really a lot and finally see why so many others do too. It has so many funny moments from beginning to end that stem from the great writing but also equally good acting for sure. These cast members pulled it off perfectly. And with that I am not just talking about those at the center of the story (also the rich Lebowski for example sadly not too many know the actor may he rest in peace) but also those that have very little screen time such as Turturro's character who is still hilarious though and also the crass difference between his scenes as a colorful bowling starlet and the exact opposite how he has to ring at everybody's door and tell them about his past. Or the German nihilists. And just people who only have one scene. That is always the Coen's strength. They make every character so damn entertaining. And this film is also a success from the time/political perspective. Could they get away with the Saddam jokes today? And pay attention to how the Dude is considered the ultimate Cannabis consumer in popular media nowadays but you never see him roll a joint. Times were different back then when it came to depicting drug (ab)use in the movies. But it also shows how progressive and ahead of its time the film and filmmakers were/are. So no matter what perspective you take this is a movie you may not want to miss out on under any circumstance and I am glad hardly anybody did looking at how many have seen it. The story may not be perfect but it never really is 100% about the story anyway. You forget quickly how the Dude and Goodman's character realize it was all a scam maybe a little too quickly because you are so in awe about all the wonderfully delightful and entertaining moments like the silent boy whose paper they find in the car etc. Like I said mentioning everything that is funny in this movie is virtually impossible because I would run into the character limit soon and still not have listed half of it all. That is why you need to experience this wonderful film yourself. Actually it made me consider buying a rug again one that really works the place. Nuff said. Highly highly recommended. Also some wonderful use of music here I have to put on my player immediately such as the Eagles song (sorry Dude it's good) ""what condition my condition was in"" or a not too famous version of ""Viva las Vegas"". All gems. The Coens are really this good with music too in their works. And you also get the usual Jew reference (special occasion here) showing us they do not take themselves seriously at all a tradition that mounted with full speed into the even better ""A Serious Man"" later on. A gem that movie as well. This one here too. What are you waiting for?",5 September 2017
You see what happens Larry?,It's hard to pick out one line of dialogue in particular for two reasons. One-almost everything said in this film is downright hilarious. And Two-the F word is spoken 281 times so there's not many sentences that don't contain it. 144 sentences also end in 'man'.Jeff 'The Dude' Lebowski is a man living a minimalistic existence. He has no job no ambitions and no worries. His days be they weekdays or weekends are spent bowling driving around or having the occasional acid flashback. His pals are Walter Sobchak a security expert and half-crazed Vietnam vet and Donny a humble mousy little man who is left out of almost every conversation.The Dude is happy with his easy-going life of nothingness until two thugs ambush him in his house believing him to the OTHER Jeff 'The Big' Lebowski the millionaire with a trouble-making wife who owes money all over town. These thugs are none too happy with their dumb error and re-assert themselves by peeing on The Dude's rug.This very much displeases The Dude as this rug really tied the room together and since he cannot track down the 'Chinaman' thug responsible he decides to take it out of the Big Lebowski as it's now HIM who owes a new rug. The Dude is welcomed into the Big Lebowski's mansion by Brandt the butler a man so appallingly sycophantic he'd make Weylon Smither's look bad. But his millionaire namesake is not so ready and willing to give hand-outs and basically tells The Dude to get lost.At this point things become quite complicated as a bunch of ex-pop star Nihilist thugs a powerful pornographer a dejected feminist daughter a Brother Seamus (NOT an Irish Monk) a joyriding teenager a revolting pederast champion bowler Saddam Hussein a mysterious cowboy and a doctor who is insistent on him removing his shorts all make The Dude's life suddenly a helluva lot more interesting. The plot thickens and thickens and the dude is dragged to dozens of different places across LA going from limo to limo never too far from a white Russian or a doobie.There are zillions of idiosyncrasies in this film that keeps it new and interesting every time you watch it. Every scene and every line of dialogue is so memorable that like me you'll be acting the film out for years. Even on a 100th viewing you'll notice dramatic ironies character arcs and ingenious wordplay that went right over your head before.The acting is superb. I am a fan of Jeff Bridges but he completely disappears in this film. He truly BECOMES The Dude and shows little of his recognisable self. John Goodman in probably the most under-rated role of his career is the world's angriest man. Bringing frustration and smart-ass arrogance to every scene (though he's almost always right). Set well over a decade after 'nam (and during the first Gulf conflict) Walter seems to be suffering from perpetual ever-lasting post-traumatic stress syndrome as he blows up in any situation. Take a look at his 'minor' confrontation with Smokey for example.It's not about plot or even characters. It's about a certain moment in time the early 90s. And the definitive man of that time was the Dude. The rug-peeing just happened to occur simultaneously.,25 September 1998
What's the Point? It isn't funny,"Spoilers ahead.I frankly do not understand why ""The Big Lebowski"" has been elevated to the point of being considered one of the best cult classics of all-time. Why this cult around the character of ""The Dude"" one of the blandest flavorless most uninteresting comedy protagonists ever to be put on celluloid? He's simply some dopey hippie who loves to hang around a John Goodman cardboard-cutout Vietnam vet gone loco (real Vets should raise their fists in anger over such an overdone unfunny disrespectful and insulting characterization) and a seldomly-seen Steve Buscemi who doesn't really do much. The plot winds into so many different twists and turns and includes so many supporting characters all of whom seek The Dude's bag of money that trying to understand this movie is like trying to untangle the Gordian Knot by hand. What's the point of placing layer upon layer upon layer of weird uninteresting characters to the point that you forget what the hell this movie is about? Nihilist German rockers? Some sicko Hugh Hefner clone? A gorgeous yet incomprehensible avant-garde artist who wants to have ""The Dude's"" baby? A strange drugstore cowboy who serves as some sort of Greek chorus? Stop it! ""Pee-Wee's Big Adventure"" had an array of weird characters but it succeeded because it had a straightforward plot and brilliant acting and writing. The Coen's monstrosity has little wit or signs of superb comic writing and all of their characters though weird are totally boring and flavorless. For weird characters to work they must act totally off-the-wall and twisted beyond realism. The weirdos in ""Lebowski"" are actually regular and seem like a mish-mash of all-too-real rejects from a yuppie coffee bar.Who likes this stuff? I have just seen ""No Country for Old Men"" and like ""Lebowski"" that was poorly written in terms of a smooth plot; and like ""Lebowski"" lacked any interesting characters. I'll give ""Fargo"" a chance; otherwise the Coen Brothers ain't reeling me in with their weird clunky movies.",10 March 2008
boe_dye sez: it wasn't funny it wasn't not funny it wasn't much of anything really,"Certain movies you can sort of understand why they are cult classics other films such as this one seem to be funny and intelligent because someone said it was funny and intelligent and therefore must be funny and intelligent.I suppose you could find deeper meaning in this or perhaps the meaning was right there on the surface. But like many of the Coen Brothers films that I have watched I either like them or I don't.The ones that I liked usually have a strong story behind them the ones that I don't like seem to be more of a ""day in the life of"" story about people who really don't seem to matter and about events that no one really cares about.Maybe there is some type of amusement in trivial matters making bored college frat boys feel more intelligent then they really are but I need something deeper for intellectual stimulation.For my comedy I don't need slapstick or pie in the face humor to make me laugh. Cynicism witty dialogue sarcasm commentary and so on not one line random events that happen out of no where with no real context and then expected to be funny.(which is not to say that slapstick pie in the face humor doesn't make me laugh at times...) A very random film with very to little no substance to it. A few quirky one liners here and there but in all honesty I was more looking at the clock waiting for this film to end then I was looking at the film waiting for it to be entertaining.Yet for some reason it has a cult following and there it is... However one should keep in mind that cults generally comprise of brainwashed individuals who really can't think for themselves anyways and generally follow wherever they are pointed to like mindless sheople...",29 August 2009
"""That rug really tied the room together""",I am delighted with the choice of actors and their performances and that's the only thing that impressed me in this film. Not stupid but not particularly witty. Not boring but not particularly fun either. Holds your attention but in a few days I won't remember what it was about. Jeff Bridges John Goodman Julianne Moore Steve Buscemi Philip Seymour Hoffman Tara Reid Peter Stormare and John Turturro all in one place are reason enough to recommend this movie but don't expect too much. Reputation far surpasses it.7/10,14 June 2020
I don't understand why this is loved by so many!,This movie is truly awful! It's supposed to be some legendary comedy but it IS NOT funny! This movie is just really weird and stupid. Literally nothing makes sense in it i hate every character except Julianne Moore's. The dude is so stupid and annoying and so is John Goodman! I was struggling to understand what in the world the plot was about and i never laughed not once! This movie's ONLY saving grace was Julianne Moore she actually did a good job and i liked her character but everything else....nope! 2/10. Save your time for a much better comedy and just movie in general such as Plains trains and automobiles or a million other better ones!,21 April 2015
Arguably the Coen Brother's funniest work with a superb lead in Bridges,"The Big Lebowski whether you laugh during the film or not is assuredly one of the most laid-back of the nineties. I don't mean that by saying that its main fan-base are slackers or hippies or other but that the whole tone of the film has that air to it. The plot the Coens construct which is as wonderfully convoluted as a 40's mystery tale (the kinds of stories they get inspired by- The Big Sleep was most likely their title goof) almost gets in the way of the main character and his friends' lives. ""The Dude"" Jeff Lebowski (Jeff Bridges) has a good if devoid of ""meaning"" life- he bowls constantly with his crazed Vietnam-vet friend Walter (John Goodman also very note-worthy) and quiet friend Donny (Steve Buscemi a fine performance based mostly on reactions) with the occasional setback or weirdo to confront him (i.e. John Turturro's Jesus a highlight in the film's most absurd moments). Enter in a group of deranged ex-musicians turned nihilists (which include the likes of Peter Stormare and Flea) a pornographer and a rich man with the same name as Lebowski and his family and the Dude's cycle is turned upside down though not knocking into his chemical intake.On top of The Big Lebowski at the core one of the most odd off-the-wall and creative of the Coens' scripts with a interesting story and dialog as real as it is sometimes insane the casting is near perfect if not so already. It's been said by the Coens that they write some of the parts specifically for the actors and it shows because it's pulled off. Aside from some usual Coen regulars that don't disappoint Bridges for lack of a better term displays his versatility in taking on this role. Often his roles are of the normal-Joe or the businessman but what the Coens see is that with the right character he can be funny and make the people around him just as funny. Not to say there aren't serious parts in the film where he's put into a rut of conflict by way of the plot. But by the time the audience starts to shift its mindset another strange surreal and/or hallucinogenic bit is kicked in. Throw in some unique production design and Roger Deakins' expert eye on the scenes (will there ever be another film that captures bowling the way this film does or at least in such scope and lack of subtlety?) and The Big Lebowski ends up as a cult classic. Not the kind of film that could really play for long in a multiplex (it made back its budget during its run but not by much) yet one that will continue to have at least a little relevance in not just the indie crowd and Coen fans but with the kinds of movie viewers who like to have a film on during a party or get-together. In fact I'd say this beats films like Dazed and Confused and Mallrats as being something that can appeal to a younger (and older depends) viewing crowd with its ridiculous set-pieces and still be a considerable artistic achievement. Look at it this way think of the silliest though smartest Cheech and Chong or Three Stooges film you've seen and when filtered through a mindset that's loaded with European and film-noir influences and you'll get The Big Lebowski. Not to mention it's one of the most quotable comedies of the 90's and has a toe-tapping soundtrack. A+",9 September 2004
unique weird but not that funny,It's 1990. Jeff Lebowski (Jeff Bridges) is a lazy bum who insists on being called Dude. Two thugs break in to shake him down and pee on his rug. They soon realize they're mistaken. They're looking for the millionaire Jeffrey Lebowski (David Huddleston) whose young wife Bunny ran up a debt. The Dude's unstable friend Walter Sobchak (John Goodman) convinces him to go see the rich Lebowski for compensation for the rug. Later Bunny is kidnapped for a $1M ransom. Rich Lebowski asks the Dude to do the ransom hand off. Walter tries to double cross the kidnappers but the drop off goes terribly wrong. The money is stolen. All the while the Dude and Walter is in a bowling tournament with Donny Kerabatsos (Steve Buscemi). Maude Lebowski (Julianne Moore) is Lebowski's daughter who wants the Dude to recover the money from the kidnappers.This is crazy Coen movie. This is a weird black comedy. It reminds me of the craziest parts of 'Raising Arizona'. It's a little too meandering with weird characters coming in every few minutes. This is much more weird than funny. I found only a few big laughs like the fking toe. On the other hand it is completely unique. A lot of it is weird for weird's sake. It's a lot of weird. I get the sense that this is a great movie to have a good smoke while watching it.,30 July 2014
The Big Lebowski,A very interesting movie that I really enjoyed watching. The characters were funny especially Walter and The Dude the story of the film was average but it was a good engine for the events of the film. The end of the film was not good.,17 December 2020

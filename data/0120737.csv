First And Still The Best Of LOTR,"Here is one film that lived up to its hype and by the time I saw it after it had arrived at the video stores I had heard and read a ton of things about it and seen all the awards it had received and expected a lot. To my surprise it did not disappoint.Now several years later after having watched all three of these ""Rings"" films twice each I still think this first movie of the trilogy is the best. It is a truly spectacular adventure story all the way through probably the best ever put to film...and the first three hours of it is extra special. The following two films were very good to be sure but this first had a better mixture of the story. The second and third movies were almost entirely Frodo and his allies' long journey but the first half of this movie also gives a good bit of interesting introductory material including a number of scenes at the Shire before the long adventure starts. If you watch all three of these films consecutively the action wears you down by midway through the final episode and it almost becomes just too much That never gets a chance to happen with the ""Fellowship"" film.Anyway ""Fellowship"" stunned me for the visuals alone. I can't recall any film that has so many jaw-dropping scenes one after the other for three straight hours. Some are beyond description and I don't care if they are computer- generated. So what? The fact is they are awesome to view both in beauty and in staggering action scenes that feature incredible-looking monsters and other mythical characters.The story covers all kinds of terrain too from the lush Shire of the Hobbits to the harsh neighboring landscapes. Each couple of minutes as in the two movies that followed scenes radically change from calmness to action adventure to romance sweet lovable characters to hideous monsters on and on and on. It's an incredible movie experience.",7 March 2006
How the hell did they film this thing,An incredible feat Enthrals anew every time Cannot believe its two decades ago Love it so much,7 March 2021
The Fellowship of the Ring: Not just a Movie but the Door to another Dimension,"The first part of the Lord of the Rings trilogy the Fellowship of the Rings opened the door to a whole new world for me. I'd never read any of Tolkien's books when I saw the film for the first time at the theatre and now that I've read them in retrospect I think being a neophyte to the mythology made my LOTR movie experience all the more miraculous.I loved The Two Towers and Return of the King almost as much as FOTR but not quite because seeing Fellowship for the first time was like taking a journey to a fabulous new place and meeting incredible new friends that you don't want to leave. I've never felt anything quite like what this epic evoked in me. It was akin to being a child again with that tireless sense of wonder and enjoyment of each and every moment maybe because as a child you are discovering your surroundings and whatever age you are when you watch the Fellowship of the Ring you are rendered in awe upon being introduced to the purity and beauty of Middle Earth and darkly enthralled by the majesty of Eisengard Saruman Sauron and all of their mighty malice. One of the things that makes this movie so special (and there are so many!) is that you fall in love not only with the ""good"" characters but also with the ""evil"" ones. For example Christopher Lee was amazing as Saruman and I can't imagine the movie without him.Some films that might be comparable to the Lord of the Rings trilogy are: The Fifth Element the Star Wars Trilogy parts IV V and VI (forget the newer prequels) the Matrix trilogy (especially the first part) Interview with a Vampire the Legend of Sleepy Hollow (with Johnny Depp) Logan's Run and The Island. They are all excellent movies and works of art that weave that movie magic that keeps you spellbound and entranced for the duration of their runtime.But after seeing The Fellowship of the Ring I knew I had found the movie by which I would judge all other movies. Based on J.R.R. Tolkien's beloved books Peter Jackson has set a new standard in the industry of cinema one that I honestly think has not and won't be surpassed at least not in my lifetime not even by PJ himself.It is truly an instant classic that will stand the test of time and be loved by generations to come. God Bless Tolkien and Jackson and everyone involved in the conception and making of this film for creating a world that is at my fingertips only takes the touch of a button to go to whenever I want and makes me forget everything else.The LOTR Trilogy is undoubtedly MY precious the non plus ultra of all movies!",14 April 2006
Great,It is my firm belief that the standard versions of The Lord of the Rings should be jettisoned in favour of the extended editions universally. Sure the near 4 hour runtime is a tad steep but for an absolute masterpiece like this it's work every second and the first act of undoubtedly the best trilogy in cinematic history!,15 February 2020
An absolutely incredible film!,Simply incredible. Never before have I seen a 3 hour movie that didn't seem like 3 hours. I read the Lord of the Rings very recently and I was surprised at how similar Peter Jackson's vision was to my own.Now about the omissions and alterations. I'm not a crazed fanatic who gets worked up over every little detail. I didn't mind Arwen's inflation and I'm actually glad Tom Bombadil was scrubbed (I felt Tom Bombadil was an unnecessary addition to the book). Despite these minor changes the screenplay stays extremely close to the book and flows very very well (and the prologue was a nice touch).The acting was flawless. As I've read many many times in other reviews McKellen doesn't play Gandalf he IS Gandalf. Wood Mortensen Holm Astin everyone was fantastic. My hat's off to Sean Bean who delivers an excellent performance as Boromir a character who's intentions are good but wrestles with the corrupting power of the Ring. Bean portrays it VERY well. Oh and Andy Serkis does a PERFECT Gollum voice. It's EXACTLY as I imagined it myself.The special effects were incredible the cave troll the balrog Gollum and Sauron's Eye all looked amazing. I was also very impressed by the seamless shrinking of the vertically challenged characters.What's wrong with this movie? I have no idea... I thought everything was perfect. MY biggest gripe is having to wait an entire year to see The Two Towers!,2 May 2002
Thank you Mr Jackson,(95%) If the late 70's early 80's had the Star wars trilogy then the 2000's had this epic fantasy masterclass. Regardless of whether you're a fantasy fan or not this is too good a movie to simply pass up and it will be one of those movies that given time will prove it to be a classic. The deeper you look into this the more one notices that every single aspect really is a truly impressive accomplishment. The fact that every single sword used by the main characters was made by hand with extra ones made only for carrying fighting etc then there's the costumes/armor/props all made by teams of many people. They even made artificial trees for gods sake. But really all those things are just extras what really makes this a unique watch is that it really does feel huge and sweeping the sense of scale is fantastic and I can't think of anything that even comes close to matching it. What every epic flick needs this has the cast is great it's exciting it has bags of character it's funny sad superbly well made with a great score and plenty of action. It's also one of very few 2 hour 30 minute + movies ever that leaves the audience wanting more. Since watching it around Christmas 2001 at a packed out cinema and the many times I've seen it on DVD since it never fails to impress and charm. All in all near perfect cinematic treat that keeps on giving.,11 November 2014
Near perfect adaptation of a fantasy benchmark,"Director Peter Jackson and wife Fran Walsh have successfully created an epic movie in both look and feel to equal J. R. R. Tolkien's novel (itself awarded the title of ""book of the century"") bringing to the big screen a film nearly flawless in its execution. My biggest disappointment is that two chapters are missing from the novel - Tom Bombadil and the following encounter with the barrow-wrights - but everything else is present and correct.Visually the film is stunning and Jackson's decision to shoot it entirely in New Zealand is one that pays off. From the incredibly lush green opening scenes of the Shire to the enchanting elvish woods to the imposing mountains and plains it really is a great film to look at and enjoy the backdrop. Even the computer-generated images like that of Mount Doom are pretty realistic. Jackson's fluid camera leads to some great sweeping shots through orc-infested mines huge towers cameras in places you've never dreamed of. The soundtrack is also perfect with Howard Shore's suspenseful exciting and emotional score a real plus especially with the cool chanting that fills the Mines of Moria sequence. On top of this great stuff is done with sound effects - in particular one scene involving a horn suddenly blowing had me jumping in my seat with its realism.I don't really need to examine the story because it sticks closely to the book with so few minor changes that it's impeccable. The script is intelligent and well-written the characters charismatic and believable in the situations they encounter. Despite a three hour running time the film never drags even in some of the slower sequences - I just didn't want it to be over while I was watching it. The costumes sets and appearances - down to the hobbits' hairy feet - are all exactly as you would picture them in the book. Jackson's bizarre arty depiction of life in the ""netherworld"" when Frodo puts on the ring and becomes invisible is as good as it could ever have been - spooky supernatural and utterly weird. Lighting pacing suspense tension and the rest - it's all here and done 100% correctly for an overall brilliant effect.Elijah Wood seemed an odd choice to me for the lead role but I immediately fell in love with his character. Through his acting he creates an emotional weak in body but strong in spirit hero a real centre piece for the film to evolve around and the film makes great use of the actor's slightly odd eyes (especially in the sequence in which he nearly becomes a wraith). Ian McKellen is also excellent as Gandalf and seems to have been perfectly cast in the role making it his own. Then there's the fellowship itself - Viggo Mortensen excels as the proud and just Strider (later Aragorn) especially in the action stakes where he fights with such fierce determination that he's a presence to behold. Orlando Bloom is fine as the elf warrior Legolas and moves as fast with his bow as he does in the book. Screen stalwart John Rhys-Davies IS Gimli the dwarf and couldn't be better. Then there's Sean Astin - lovable as the dopey but loyal Sam Gamgee and Billy Boyd and Dominic Monaghan in slight comic relief roles as hobbit buddies Pip and Merry. Finally kudos to Sean Bean for creating in Boromir a flawed but deeply likable and understandable character with a sympathetic performance that eclipses all of the actor's previous work - bravo.The action sequences are magnificent and really get the heart going - they put you into the middle of the action with all the blood sweat and clanging steel and are edge-of-the-seat stuff. Highlights include Strider fighting the ring-wraiths with his burning brand on Weathertop and the final assault by orcs on the fellowship which leads to one of the most noble deaths ever in a film. And what of the special effects? In a film dominated by CGI work I'm happy to say that most are unnoticeable. The digital manipulation to create four-foot hobbits is sometimes dodgy but most of the time you don't notice. The backdrops and effects are great expensive looking but solid and real at the same time - whoever said they look ""cartoony"" just got it wrong.My favourite scene in the movie is the Mines of Moria sequence - a fantasy fan's dream come true and the best on screen depiction of a Dungeons & Dragons game so far. The lurker in the lake is a Lovecraftian monster par excellence and the spooky and atmospheric trip through the corpse-strewn deserted mines exceptionally eerie stuff. Then follows a fantastic battle with a cave troll thankfully on screen for a fair amount of time so we get to admire the fluid and superb effects and then a truly gob-smacking encounter with the fiery Balrog just as you imagine it from the book. This half an hour is probably the best film sequence I've ever seen flawless and perfect in its depiction - amazing. A highlight of what is an impressive and epic film throughout and a must see for any film fan worth their salt - I can't recommend this film highly enough and plan to watch it again before the cinema run expires. In my opinion this is better than any STAR WARS movie or HARRY POTTER - and easily one of the best fantasy movies ever made although it has to be said the competition isn't exactly stiff. Bring on the sequel!",19 August 2016
"""Remember what Bilbo used to say it's dangerous business Frodo going out the door.""","When I first read ""The Hobbit"" and ""The Lord of the Rings"" Trilogy back in the early 1970's I recall saying to myself that the story would make a wonderful movie. ""Star Wars"" still hadn't come out yet and realizing that the available technology could not do justice to the fantastic world presented by J.R.R. Tolkien it was simply best left to the imagination.Well imagination has found life in ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" a truly profound epic that sets the standard for film fantasy just as the books did for the written word. Upon first seeing it during it's initial release I couldn't have been happier with the amount of detail it offered while remaining true to the original adventure. Everyone imagines what a story and characters look like in their own mind; it was as if Peter Jackson tapped a great cosmic consciousness to deliver a tale that captured the tone and pacing of the novel dead on.I feel that readers of the trilogy have a leg up on the characters and locations of Middle Earth as they are revealed in the film quickly and with nominal explanation. For example when the Black Riders appear for the first time it's difficult to grasp what they're all about other than the fact that they're after the ring. Strider's explanation of the Nazgul is perfect - ring wraiths who were once men neither alive nor dead who always feel the power of the ring. Coming to the movie with that understanding ahead of time helps the viewer have a greater appreciation of the action taking place.The real magic of the movie for me is the seamless manner in which the various races coexist and interact with each other. Though levels of unfamiliarity and distrust appear can anyone coming out of the movie doubt that elves dwarfs hobbits and wizards actually exist. Even orcs and evil Uruk hai have a place in this world for without the danger they pose there is no triumph.If the movie captures your imagination and you haven't read the trilogy or it's prequel ""The Hobbit"" you'll be doing yourself a favor to do so. There in even more exquisite detail are nuances such as Elvish poetry and additional characters that provide more depth and color to the world of Middle Earth. It's a world easy to get lost in and makes one appreciate a writer of legendary proportion who invented a land people and language all of his own that can now be shared with everyone.",22 December 2005
Tolkien's Brilliant Vision Realized Into A Perfect Film,For the thousands of fans who thought it couldn't be done to the skeptics and the critics who observed Peter Jackson's adaptation of the Lord Of The Rings into a trilogy would be the next Ishtar a disaster of epic proportions allay your fears. The Lord Of The Rings: The Fellowship Of The Ring is the most daring cinematic event to take place in years and despite the fact it undeservedly lost the best picture oscar to A Beautiful Mind it is I strongly believe a film for the ages. NOt since Gone With THe Wind has an epic tale critically acclaimed been adapted into a film which is astounding in its own right. The sets are marvelous the characters portrayed to perfection (Most notably Ian McKellen as Gandalf) and the mythology of Middle-Earth brought to vivid life combining to make a film that is both spectacular in its grandeur and engaging in its characters. This is a film I believe equal to Lawrence Of Arabia in its scope and I am anxiously awaiting the sequel THe Two Towers being released this Christmas.,26 June 2002
An amazing beginning of the trilogy. An amazing end of the movie.,"""For the time will soon come when Hobbits will shape the fortunes of all."" GaladrielGaladriel tells Hobbits may look like unimportant people but they will change the course of the future. Story begins with this line.This line is not really the first line but the line stars the movie for real. This movie is breathtaking. Whatever I say is not enough for this trilogy. Brilliant novel brilliant adapted screenplay.Not just the novel or screenplay is excellent but the technics also revolutionary. The trilogy nearly opened a new era to Cinema. Some believed even more revolutionary than Star Wars and 2001: A Space Odyssey. Amazing makeup breathtaking visual effects stunning cinematography. The trilogy nearly succeed at all technical subjects.",14 June 2019
The Fantasy Motion Picture to Rule Them All...,Barely ever hearing of The Lord of the Rings I went in to see this film in theaters the consecutive Friday it was released to not only be flabbergasted at its greatness but wanting more! Since then I devoted myself to seeing the following two films on the first day of release -- a promise I kept.Peter Jackson's take on Tolkien's fantasy masterpiece not only carries a great deal of the text to full film fruition but shows the power of film and proving that nothing is impossible. Jackson's vision is continuous and never seems to loose grasp of the story that is being told. Using the artistry of John Howe and Alan Lee The Fellowship of the Ring gleams with a beautiful and dark atmosphere a length of detail that makes it seem like everyone and everything has its own history and full of wondrous images one could never imagine.The acting is superb. With a complex script each actor has transformed these characters into 3-D people with deep back-story and people that we feel compassion for. This is one extraordinary ensemble cast. Each actor IS that character making it seem impossible to imagine anyone else fill that person's shoe in their stead. Viggo Mortensen IS Aragorn. Sir Ian McKellen IS Gandalf the Grey. Elijah Wood IS Frodo Baggins. One could weep with our heroes should one fall or feel inspired when they achieve victory. A fantasy with this much emotion just seems surreal but it's completely believable.Never losing pace the writing and direction is flawless making for one enthralling introduction into Middle-earth. The voice over prologue fills even the most uneducated audience member with all the necessary knowledge they need to know in order to understand our heroes' and villains' motives. Some things of course have been omitted for pacing reasons. While not present in the theatrical cut we do see the passing of the Grey Elves and get a brief tale of Beren and Luthien. The barrow-wights and their story is no where to be seen (as interesting as it is in the book there really is no place for it in this film) and Tom Bombadil is absent as well but thankfully to the ingeniousness of the writers in the Extended Edition of The Two Towers a little homage is paid to the character. Omissions and changes are always part of adapting a book to film and the ones made by Peter Jackson Phillipa Boyens and Fran Walsh are justifiable in every way.The action scenes are spaced out thoroughly enough for breathing room plot advancement and ever-continuing character development. Each action scene is its own be it the flight to the Fjords of Bruinen the Mines of Moria or the showdown at Amon Hen near the end of the film. All are greatly choreographed each stunt member and actor is full of energy and ambition as they wield deadly weapons at each others' heads and limbs. It really is a sight to behold.The special effects are mesmerizing. The use of CGI miniatures/bigatures and even clever camera angles blend to make one ideal image after the other. The soaring images of Barad-dur or Orthanc seem real when in fact they only stand so many feet high. The Argonath two figures of enormous height standing before the Anduin River seem like 300 foot creations when in fact they are about only several feet off the ground. Simply jaw-dropping imagery.Howard Shore's score for The Fellowship of the Ring is a beautiful epic and complex piece of work that makes one feel like they have been entranced. Even when some of the text seems omitted from the screen it can be heard through the powerful instrumentation conducted and created by this composer. The use of leitmotifs to symbolize a country race or character is stunning.Overall The Lord of the Rings - The Fellowship of the Ring is a visionary masterpiece allowing the world to see what seems like actual history with fantastic elements equaling the greatness of Hollywood's earlier classics. As the first of three one who has not seen these films can await the next several hours of their lives to be changed for ever.,26 August 2008
Part One: With Help Even the Impossible Can Be Achieved,"Peter Jackson set out to make movies which the author of the Lord of the Rings trilogy J.R.R. Tolkien would have endorsed. All three were resounding successes though because of the film medium they necessarily varied from Tolkien's story-line. Purists may have issues with Jackson's theatrical license but as someone who has read Tolkien's books several times and seen the films 4-5 times each I never felt that Jackson went too far or compromised Tolkien's story the mythology he developed or the wonderful characters he brought to life. Many have said what Jackson did could not be done. He has not only proved the nay-sayers wrong but lovingly crafted a set of films which will for many decades to come stand out as a great achievement. This is the first of three reviews I am publishing on IMDb for these films. I am labeling them Parts 1 2 and 3 just in case anybody wants to read them in order. The reviews will be self-contained but will also be enhanced by a chronological reading. My reviews will focus on the extended edition DVDs though my comments are also relevant to the theatrical releases.The Fellowship of the Ring introduces the key characters and the broad story arc of the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Wizard Gandalf the Grey travels to a small town for small people (Hobbits)to help celebrate Bilbo Baggins' birthday. The very elderly Baggins doesn't look a day over 45 and soon it becomes apparent why. Since the great adventure of his life a quest he was sent on by Gandalf himself he has possessed the most powerful object in all of Middle Earth  The One Ring. This ring is evil incarnate with an insatiable lust for power it taints every creature who possesses it and tries to work its way back to its creator  Dark Lord Sauron. Bilbo uses the ring to disappear as he intends to spend his senescence with his friends the Elves in Rivendell. But activating the ring he draws the attention of Lord Sauron from thousands of miles away in the land of Mordor. Realizing what has occurred Gandalf scrambles to determine a course of action and recruits Bilbo's nephew Frodo and his loyal gardener Samwise to bear the ring to the Council of Elrond in Rivendell. Thusly the seeds of the fellowship are planted in the soil of the Shire.At this point we are about 1/6th of the way through The Fellowship. Fairly soon thereafter it becomes clear who will compose the fellowship and who and what these people are. Though the succeeding films are not entitled ""Fellowship"" they follow the adventures of the surviving central characters. Characterization is done just as Tolkien did it in the original novel  by example not discourse. For example we are given hints to the identity of Strider (Mortenson) earlier on in the movie than in the novel but the actual significance of this remains ambiguous until about midway through. Strong characterization is key to the success of the entire trilogy. To summarize Peter Jackson his team and cast  NAIL the characterization. The casting and acting is perfect. It is very difficult to resist the temptation to single out Mortenson and McKellen for carrying their difficult roles so well (Strider/Aragorn and Gandalf) but why risk diminishing the contributions of the rest of the cast? Nobody mis-steps and it is clear from the beginning that the entire cast was thoroughly and completed engaged with the task before them.Tolkien believed that no film would ever do his work justice and until this trilogy he was correct.Peter Jackson and his team have managed to do exactly what they set out to. As Jackson himself has said in reference to the film trilogy they set out to 'make Tolkien's film.' Jackson successfully drew out elements of all three books expanding and contracting rearranging and sometimes adding whole subplots which are hinted at in the books but not well explained in order to adopt the grand story to the film medium. Arwen (Liv Tyler) daughter of Elrond and Elven lover of Aragorn for example is introduced early in the films and plays a role in the films which is much more equal to her significance than it was in the books.The Howard Shore score is lovely and its simple themes are used to great effect throughout all three movies. The musical collaborations improvising on Shore's basic themes are great and though they feature some prominent performers  are never weighed down by star-power.Jackson made all three movies simultaneously. This technique allowed for perfect continuity and permitted much greater flexibility in editing and post-production work than would normally be allowed. Knowing that he would need to establish and support his own fellowship to make this production work he also knew that success would make the production legendary. So he documented the creation of the films beautifully. Two complete DVDs full of documentary pieces are included in all three Special Edition Packages in the trilogy. Many are likely to be bored by the details in these documentaries but those interested in the creative process behind the films will be provided with a more comprehensive view than I can remember ever seeing in any similar DVD package. The Fellowship of the Rings is as true a representation of Tolkien's novel as can be imagined. Although some aspects of the stories in the novel were adapted to the screen the essentials the characters and the overall story are not just recognizable but ENHANCED by the film. What results is a film that is not just entertaining but an enormous fulfillment of an undying wish of millions of fans around the world.Very highly recommended.",30 November 2007
From the beginning...,"...I wasn't sure anyone would have ever guessed (except in a 2004 Fangoria magazine article written by Mexican visionary Guillermo del Toro) that New Zealand native Peter Jackson the director behind the ""goriest movie ever made"" (1992's ""Dead Alive"") would have been behind the epic three-film installment of ""The Lord of the Rings"" saga which include ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" (2001) ""The Two Towers"" (2002) and Best Picture Oscar-winner ""The Return of the King"" (2003).***Note*** This comment applies to all three movies as it will be posted at each individual web page.Not since ""Star Wars"" has this much hype surrounded films of this magnitude. But I guess such hype exists because J.R.R. Tolkien's books have one of the largest devoted fanbases of any popular reading material. I've never read Tolkien's original books though several readers as well as fans of the movies have told me such knowledge is not required when viewing ""The Lord of the Rings"" films. ""The Lord of the Rings"" is the biggest movie I've ever seen and there's a whole lot of story 12+ hours to be exact and I've spent the last two days viewing the extended versions of all three movies and they are breathtaking. There are many dazzling special effects shots over the course of the trilogy and epic battle sequences to put you in awe (many of which in my view do push the limits of the ""PG-13"" rating) not because it's action but because of how precise Jackson's direction is and how unflinching the camera becomes when it's time for battle. The rousing epic score by Howard Shore helps the viewer get ""into"" Jackson's vision of Middle-earth and into the characters and on-screen action. Jackson has also breathtakingly transformed his New Zealand homeland into Tolkien's Middle-earth and when you watch these movies you feel like you're really there with the rest of its inhabitants. It is also pretty frightening too with many jump scenes including the frequent and violent battle sequences between our heroes and ""The Enemy"" who include the brutish Orcs Moria Orcs Ringwraiths and the unreal entity Sauron. And lastly the cast does much more than bring the action to life but instead live (""live"" is italicized) their parts. Of course I'm talking about the young Hobbits Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) who come into possession of the ancient One Ring and must journey to the hellish land Mordor to cast the talisman into a river of lava and bring its reign of evil to an end. Along the way two other Hobbits Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd) necromancer Gandalf (Sir Ian McKellen) warrior Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) Boromir (Sean Bean) elf Legalos (Orlando Bloom) and dwarf Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) aid them in their quest - together as a ""fellowship of the ring."" There are also plenty of other fantastic supporting roles from Cate Blanchett Ian Holm Christopher Lee Liv Tyler Hugo Weaving (Agent Smith plays a good guy) and Andy Serkis as the voice of the ever-creepy Gollum. I think J.R.R. Tolkien would be proud of Peter Jackson's take on his material despite comments I've heard his son has made in undermining the director's vision. Someone once called ""The Lord of the Rings"" the greatest fantasy epic ever made; they were right.10/10",3 August 2005
Wow!,Breathtaking. Unique. Captivating. Enchanting.Within minutes of the start of this first chapter of an undeniably epic trilogy the audience was left gasping at the intensity of the images on the screen. And we had nearly three hours to go.The scope of Tolkien's masterpiece may have eluded film-makers for decades but director Peter Jackson makes good on his promise: he has not only brought us the tale of Frodo and his bold companions he has brought us Middle Earth. And believe me it is BIG. Sweeping vistas and hang-onto-your-seat camera shots send us zooming through the towering cities and citadels of Tolkien's imagination.But even more impressive than the stunning visuals and sound-effects-like-you've-never-heard-before are the actors who breathe life into the characters. Ian McKellen's portrayal of Gandalf is nothing short of awe-inspiring and Elijah Wood's Frodo is one of the most unexpectedly captivating performances I've seen in a long time. The despair terror and determination of the Fellowship is all there in spades. I left the theater aching...from tensing every muscle during the fight and flight sequences--the breathless and compelling kind we haven't seen since Spielberg gave us a desperate charge onto the D-Day beaches of Normandy.Those unfamiliar with Tolkien's world may quickly find themselves lost in it but happily so. The depth of his creation cannot be grasped in a few hours and it doesn't need to be; the struggle of good against evil explodes on the screen and leaves little room for complaint.The movie ended with a stunned audience sitting on the edges of their seats feeling somewhat bereft. We were exhausted but no one wanted to wait a year for more.Jackson's ambitious first chapter is truly unlike anything you've seen this year. George Lucas and Chris Columbus take note: this is how you deliver on a cinematic promise.For everyone else: don't you dare miss it.,11 December 2001
Never read the book but loved the movie!,I didn't know quite what to expect when I went into the theater all I knew is that I wanted to see a fantasy film with sword fights magic and monsters. I was not disappointed. It exceeded my expectations because it had all the stuff I mentioned and great acting and good character development as well. I was enjoying the movie so much that I was very disappointed when it ended. I would have gladly stayed another six hours if the showed the next two installments of this flick. That was the only bad part of the film is the abrupt ending but I still give this movie a 10 because it is a trilogy and I was expecting it. If you want to see a great movie one that delivers where so many have promised but failed to deliever then this is the film to see...even if you didn't read the book. And for anyone who has read the book I would love to hear your take on the movie just don't give anything away about the next two parts.,7 January 2002
Embrace the magic,It is with no surprise that Peter Jackson's The Fellowship of the Ring film has received such mixed critics. Many viewers refer to it as being childish boring and uninteresting. Seems to me that it is bound to the same fate of Tolkien's books destined to be a target for the same type of misunderstandings that keep attacking this literary masterpiece many decades after it's first publication.Having read the books several years ago I went to see this `impossible' film when it came out with many doubts on my mind. I really liked it but left the theater with as many doubts as I had before. Was it perfect? Well maybe not but what an achievement. After watching it a few times on DVD and thinking about it for some time now I find myself loving this film more and more. Let me tell you why...The Lord of the Rings is a fairy-tale of myth and fantasy. Peter Jackson directed a film that was considered for a very long time impossible to make and not only for technical reasons. The narrative roots are incredibly long and detailed and the storyline is deeply connected with the creation of a fantastic continent from a time unknown called `Middle Earth'. It's author Tolkien dedicated a considerable part of his life developing this continent's background it's mythology and origins it's different kinds of people cultures and languages and therefore it's geographic references are determinant to the unfolding of the story of the One Ring.Peter Jackson went out to achieve the impossible and came out with a recreation of the original that is pure and true to the story in every detail. The first time the four hobbits meet a black rider on the road for example is absolutely faithful to the feeling of the book. The assault of the riders at Weathertop is another great example and it captures that feeling of danger density and atmosphere that are the main characteristics of the tale. Jackson also took some liberties with the story and made some right choices along the way. If the so called `purists' may not approve the removal of Tom Bombadil altogether it should be comprehensible that the travel from Hobbiton to Rivendel is a very long and detailed one and could easily make a movie on it's own. I felt more uneasy with how short the Council of Elrond was. In the book the council is where the whole story of the rings is first explained and many passages from the past ages of Middle Earth are unveiled. It is a fascinating moment of the story that had to be shortened for obvious reasons. Still after some consideration I now agree with the options made by Peter Jackson and think that the movie prologue narrated by Galadriel was the wisest choice. The magic is all there when Gandalf shuts his eyes the moment Frodo stands in the council and says `I will take the ring'. It is there at Moria's Gate and at the fall of Boromir. It is a powerful film that doesn't fit the rhythm of the standard Hollywood action movie. It is a film that breeds that takes time to unfold it's tale branching in every direction.I could go on and on talking about all the different elements that bring this film close to perfection but I'll end saying that deep down this is not about action beards and big monsters. The greatest thing about this film to me is that it brought me back to a time when I was in love with a different world where everything was possible. Reading The Lord of the Rings night after night I came to understand what this thing of `mankind' really was all about. The corruption of absolute power the importance and value of friendship the inevitability of growing up the strength of hope... That this film could capture that magic and be a new bearer to it's message of humanism is a statement to it's greatness. Gandalf's words that even the smallest person may change the course of the world and have a part to play in the destiny of all are immortal.In the end this is a wonderful film but that doesn't mean you are going to like it. I cannot tell you what it is like to see this film if you don't know or love the book. But I hope it may plant a seed on your heart to discover a great world of fantasy beauty and humanity. I believe Tolkien would have liked that.,8 October 2002
Excellent,"Incredible adaptation of the first book of J.R.R. Tolkien's ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy. I'm not going to summarize the story--there's way to much going on. All I'll say is they took a verry difficult book with a intricate plot and made it an exciting totally accesible movie. The film moves quickly (with a few slow spots--but that's to get in the plot) and there's a lot to take in but I was never confused. I should mention that I tried twice to read the books but found them too hard.The film looks magical--Middle Earth looks beautifully real. All the special effects are great (the Ring Wraiths are downright terrifying--as they should be) and the action sequences are among the best I've ever seen--fast long and breathtaking. The film is long (2 hrs 40 min) but the time flies by. The only problem is that there's so much plot and action going on that you're exhausted by the end--but in a good way.With the exception of Viggo Mortensen (very wooden) all the actors are good--top honors go to Elijah Wood Dominic Monaghan Cate Blanchett Liv Tyler and (especially) Ian McKellan.But the film is VERY violent (despite the PG-13 rating). It deserves an R--this is NOT one for the kids. Still it's the best film of 2001. SEE IT!!!!",3 January 2002
I Don't Know if They Could Do It Much Better,I am not fanatic though I have read the books a couple of times. My interest in J. R. R. Tolkien goes to his knowledge of the history of language as well as his work in fantasy. I've seen some of the bad animation that was done using his work. I always assumed that this would be the only vehicle that could be used to bring these works to the screen. Now with a new generation of special effects masters we have a work of art like the world has never seen. Granted there can never be a definitive work that matches the depth and poetry of the books but this captures the charm the wonder the amazing epic. To see the Shire presented in the first scenes and the party in the home of Bilbo as the creatures of this amazing fantasy are exposed is one of those incredible moments. The story is set up for the ultimate adventure as Frodo paddles out onto that lake not knowing what has been set in motion. I will leave the real reviews to others. My first thought upon seeing this was I just hope I survive to see it to its conclusion.,2 March 2006
A truly exceptional film,There is very little that can be said about The Lord of the Rings that hasn't been said already many times over. But what can be re-iterated is that The Fellowship of the Ring is an outstanding piece of film-making.Where do you start when reviewing a film the size of Lord of the Rings? J.R.R. Tolkein's seminal masterwork long considered unfilmable has made it on to the screen thanks to visionary director Peter Jackson. The Fellowship of the Ring is the first of the three books of the trilogy. Everyone has their favourite of the three and this one is probably mine. Unrivalled in its size and scale by virtually any other film with new groundbreaking special and digital effects a stunning musical score universally superb acting and most importantly a superb story.The Fellowship of the Ring is the first part of the epic trilogy that tells of the quest of a hobbit to destroy an evil ring of power. He is aided in his quest by his friends and other companions who accompany him and protect him on his journey. Many threats face him on his long journey both from the world around him and from his companions who could be tempted by the power of the ring he has set out to destroy. It is a tale of magic and fantasy swords and sorcery but it is not simply for teens who enjoy dungeons and dragons games. It is accessible to everyone. By turns exciting frightening funny and sad it is a true masterpiece in terms of storytelling encompassing the full spectrum of emotions.The acting is superb from the entire cast and it is unfathomable as to how the Academy overlooked the acting entirely for all three films when dishing out awards and nominations. However the performances from Ian McKellan Viggo Mortensen Sean Astin Elijah Wood and Sean Bean are all so good it would have possibly been greatly unfair to single any one out for an award.The film also contains some groundbreaking computer-generated special effects and some positively genius scale work. Due to hobbits being only about 3 feet tall some clever scale work was needed in order to ensure that John Rhys-Davies a dwarf in the film but over 6 feet tall in real life did in fact look the height of a dwarf. This was done through clever use of forced perspectives scale doubles giant sets and blue screen filming. However the most impressive use of computer effects lies later in the trilogy with the appearance of Gollum  cinema's first live-action character who is completely computer generated. The music is also beautiful and Howard Shore has created possibly the most iconic and memorable score since John Williams' Star Wars.Peter Jackson has until Lord of the Rings been seen as a director outside of the mainstream but his superb career-defining work on the Lord of the Rings trilogy has seen him well and truly propelled him to the forefront of Hollywood. He has re-defined the epic film with unparalleled success and created films that will definitely stand the test of time to one day be thought of with the same reverence as the Star Wars and Godfather trilogies.A major milestone in cinema history the trilogy would eventually gain seventeen Oscars between the three films. Lord of the Rings is a master class in storytelling and essential viewing.,28 February 2006
A Masterpiece,"I've never been a fan of the sword and sorcery genre . I'm surprised film companies decide to make rubbish like THE BEASTMASTER HAWK THE SLAYER and RED SONJA but I am aware of the popularity of JRR Tolkien's massive novel LORD OF THE RINGS and of it's popularity  I remember in a survey carried out by a very well known British fantasy/SF magazine in 1987 Tolkien's book was voted the greatest fantasy novel of all time ( THE STAND by Stephen King was a long way second )  but it's a novel that has always struck me as being read by anoraks who - like fans of STAR TREK and STAR WARS - insist on reading subtexts that are just not there . When the THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RINGS shot to number one in the IMDb top 250 films I put the popularity down to obsessed anorakish fans who were going to vote the film a classic no matter what . Stranger still I found groups as diverse as neo Nazis to gays to enviromentalists proclaiming "" This is our film "" so when I finally sat down to watch TFOTR I was expecting only some average entertainment for a non sad person with no political axe to grind . After seeing the film I had to admit THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING is a masterpiece .Much of the credit must go to the producers . I 've no idea of the politics about bringing the story to the silver screen but I can imagine the Hollywood bigwigs sitting around the commitee table saying "" Give us Tom  give us Nicole  get Harrison  get Leonardo . No limeys . Limeys are slimy . No limey accents . We're Americans  this is our baby "" to which the producers gave a firm and resounding "" No "" . Good for them because the Hollywood treatment would have ruined this film. The cast comprised of well known - but not megastar - actors and unknowns are uniformally excellent even the normally hammy Lee and Rhys Davis and the bland Tyler are good . Also great to see so many Brits playing good guys and having the American actors adopting non specific British accents .The cast do a good jobThe other production values are outstanding . Pride of place goes to Andrew Lesnie's cinematography where the camera sweeps down from the sky into the Orcs underground lair and the camera also shows off the stunning New Zealand landscapes . I'd always believed Scotland had the greatest scenery on Earth but I'm willing to change my mind . The FX are good throughout though perhaps the matte backgrounds and CGI are less impressive in places but they're still a lot better than we've been used to recently . The Orc make up is wonderful and helps them become classic cinema monsters . The only bad point about the Orcs is - Like the stormtroopers in STAR WARS - they're too easy to kill .There are some minor flaws to THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RINGS but this is probably down to Tolkien's source novel rather than the film makers . A couple of times the heroes seem set to suffer a resounding defeat when something not obvious at first like flammable villains or a giant eagle saves the day . I guess this is cancelled out by the dangers and adversaries also appearing from nowhere and there's little female perspective in the story for the women in the audience to relate to but come on girls you've got Viggo Mortensen and Sean Bean acting all hunky and macho so you can't complain.I see the IMDb reviewers have started a backlash against FOTR like they did with TITANIC and GLADIATOR . They're right about the gawd awful rubbish that is TITANIC but they're wrong about GLADIATOR which is a very good film and even further wrong about THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING which is a cinematic masterpiece. Ignore their criticisms . Any film that is praised by people as diverse as fans of the book  people who have never read the book  enviromentalists and cynics like myself is worth your time watching . I'm really looking forward to THE TWO TOWERS",16 August 2002
Three Rings for the Elven Kings Under The Sky........,I wish I could quote the whole poem. The Lord of the Rings is far and away the BEST MOVIE OF 2001!!! And #2 of all time!!! Right behind the Star Wars trilogy (which I count as one movie) and right above the Longest Day. The movie does it's best to follow the books (and cuts out several pointless parts) and is just as I pictured it. AMZING acting UNBELEAVIBLE fx AND ALL AROUND ONE OF THE MOST SPECTACULAR MOVIE OF ALL TIME!!! 10/10!!! and I only resurve that for the BEST the most FLAWLESS of movies!!! Nominated for 13 academy awards and should've won all of them!!! but the academy ALWAYS goes for the artsy movies!!!!,8 July 2002
Don't care what the Academy says Best film of 2001 and best of many others.,LOTR is without a doubt the best movie I've ever seen. I don't care what the Academy says because without a doubt it was the best film of 2001 (obviously... i said it was the best movie I've ever seen). It deserved the Academy Award 10 times more than A Beautiful Mind did. I mean look at the difference between ratings. LOTR: #3 ABM: #126 See a difference? LOTR will go on to be an unforgotten movie as what Star Wars is. In twenty years ABM won't even be on the top 250 list while LOTR will still be in the top 50. SO LOTR fans just remember. Academy doesn't mean sh*t. Time says it all.,27 March 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring,There can be little doubt that the Lord of the Rings film are the greatest trilogy of all time. At the time of writing the films sit on the top 250 at 7th 10th and 14th. No other trilogy is so highly rated. The Godfather Part III is nowhere to be seen on the Top 250.Peter Jackson + Howard Shore + The the amazing actors (every single one was absolutely brilliant from Elijah Wood to Marton Csokas. Not to mention all the stunt doubles special effects team editors all all others who made this film/these films what they are. And a special thanks to the country of New Zealand for being so very beautiful!This is my favourite film of all time no doubt about it there are no criticisms that I believe are valid!,26 July 2021
Middle Earth comes alive...in breathtaking detail.,"When I first saw the trailers for ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" I had never had any interest in reading the lengthy tome of a trilogy. But seeing the possibility of the movie I immediately went out and read the whole thing insisted on receiving it for Christmas and enjoyed every minute of it. The feelings I had while reading the series were heightened seeing it come to life in the stunning movie. I thought it was a fabulous work of art.I thought that having Galadriel tell what was basically the prologue of the book was a good idea as it helped those who had never read the story. It also immediately involved me in the film; I felt I had an insider's advantage on the rest of the audience. Cate Blanchett has a wonderfully deep and emotional voice; the way she speaks Galadriel is almost as effective as her appearence as the Elven queen. Also showing the last battle of Isildur and Sauron helped unfog a part of the novel that had me a trifle confused.The entire movie is full of beautiful sets and landscapes. The Shire was almost exactly as I'd pictured it. Hobbiton is cute and very whimsical. Mordor was frighteningly well done extremely real. Rivendell had a little bit of a European-tourist-trap look but was beautiful all the same. The entire backdrop of the movie (the mountains Moria Isengard) was perfect; it's amazing that ""Fellowship"" was filmed in one country.Now to the characters. All I can say is ""Wow."" I was a little apprehensive about the casting at first; I'd created such real images of the characters in my imagination I almost didn't want them spoiled for me. However I was not disapointed in the least. Elijah Wood though not one of my favorite actors was believable. You could tell from the first glimpse that Frodo was special; Wood's pale sharp features contrast sharply with the more ruddy robust look of the rest of the hobbits. He also cries like a little girl. But his weaknesses and strengths make his Frodo an apt choice for the starring character. The rest of the Hobbiton gang was well-chosen too. Sean Astin (""Rudy"" forever to me) was loyal and a bit bumbling just like the Gamgee of Tolkien's telling. Pippin and Merry were congenial slow-witted lads but very brave nonetheless. Viggo Mortensen is outstanding. He has the ability to make Aragorn both menacing and kind. He physically represents Strider to the nines with his strength and virility; the action sequences of his are very passionate and exciting. Some may have complained about Arwen's character being slightly expanded; I thought it a good change. In the books you have to read the whole trilogy and then rifle through the appendix in ""The Return of the King"" to learn the history between Aragorn and Arwen. Liv Tyler is ethereal and breathtaking but at the same time displays the courage and magic that make the Elves the beings they are. Speaking of Elves I can't help but gush over the handsome and ever-so-talented Orlando Bloom as noble Legolas. Bloom captured the archer's very movements; he treads lightly and fights fearlessly. Legolas's bowmanship was amazing; he looked so natural loosing his arrows machine-gun style. He was my favorite character in the books and his essence transcends the film. Gimli was pompous and brave as well. He is well-represented in the movie. Boromir was hopelessly lost but at the same time valiant and strong. Sean Bean gave an emotionally-charged performance as the tortured warrior. Hugo Weaving was very good as Elrond. He was noble and cold at the same time. And Gandalf. What more can be said of Ian McKellan's showcase portrayal of the wizard? He was magnificent. He could be Gandalf the kind old conjurer who set off pyrotechnics for hobbit-children. Then he could turn around and stun the life out of you with Gandalf the powerful wizard facing the balrog with defiance and an iron will. His Oscar nomination is well-deserved.Peter Jackson is a brave soul to take on a project that could have backfired in so many places. Instead of bringing us uninspired kitsch he serves up raw emotion graphic battles of good and evil chilling and wonderful characters and enough special effects (realistic mind you) to make John Cameron's mouth water. Knowing that ""The Two Towers"" was my favorite of the books I eagerly anticipate the second helping of ""The Lord of the Rings.""",17 February 2002
Excellent adventure,"Personally I'm not a big fan of fantasy. I find it rather pretentious and for most entries into the genre silly and/or melodramatic. But Peter Jackson's ""Lord of the Rings"" is an exception. It's a grand adventure filled with limitless energy and likable characters. The series is at the top of the IMDb ""Top 250"" list and rightly so. The first installment is extraordinary.I'm going to skip over the plot because by now everyone knows it. The acting is pitch-perfect across the board. Elijah Wood has clearly grown out of his kid roles and is terrific as Frodo. His co-star Ian McKellen may have gotten the Oscar nod for his role but Wood equals him. Likewise McKellen finds the right note for Gandalf. Everyone else is perfectly suited for their roles as well. Special note goes to Sean Bean who made a career out of playing creeps and villains is successful as Boromir and shows that he has more range than people may give him credit for.The stakes were incredibly high for this film series and obviously it paid off. Peter Jackson deserves much of the credit. His work here is the fantasy answer to George Lucas' ""Star Wars"" saga. Unlike much of today's CGI it wasn't done cheaply and everything looks authentic and the result is breathtaking. It's hard to tell what's real and what's not. But Jackson's skill goes beyond the effects. Much of the acclaim of Tolkien's series is the fact that he created a whole new world. Jackson does the same thing; it doesn't feel like a bunch of effects were added to sets or everything was in front of a blue screen. Jackson has created a whole new world just like Tolkien did.Of course this would not be worth anything if Jackson and his co-writers hadn't written a screen adaptation that was worthy of the book (which I have not read). Everything moves smoothly and nothing feels left out or short-changed.Many films have been destroyed by too much hype. But ""The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring"" is so grand that nothing could diminish its spectacle. And what a film to deserve it!",28 July 2008

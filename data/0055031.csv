Fantastic acting script and direction in a thought-provoking movie,Outstanding film. Star-studded with several fantastic performances. Highly emotional given the subject matter but presented in a very intelligent balanced way. I was struck at once by that and by how well director Stanley Kramer gives us both sides of the argument – and avoids simply paying lip service to the defense of the German judges on trial. Maximilian Schell is brilliant as the defense attorney well worthy of his Oscar and is forceful and compelling in his arguments. There are also so many brilliant scenes. Spencer Tracy walking in the empty arena where the Nazi rallies were held with Kramer focusing on the dais from which Hitler spoke. The testimony of Montgomery Clift and Judy Garland both of whom are outstanding and should have gotten Oscars. Burt Lancaster in the role of one of the German judges the one tortured by his complicity knowing he and others are guilty. The devastating real film clips from the concentration camps which are still spine tingling despite all we 'know' or have been exposed to. Marlene Dietrich as the German general's wife haunted but expressing the German viewpoint one time while people are singing over drinks. Her night stroll with Tracy as she explains the words to one song is touching. It just seemed like there was just one powerhouse scene after another and the film did not seem long at all at three hours. Heck you've even got Werner Klemperer and William Shatner before they would become Colonel Klink and Captain Kirk! In this film the acting the script and the direction are all brilliant and in harmony with one another.As for the trial itself the defense argument was along these lines: they were judges (and therefore interpreters) not makers of law. They didn't know about the atrocities in the concentration camps. At least one of them saved or helped many by staying in their roles and doing the best they could under the heavy hand of the Third Reich. They were patriots saw improvement in the country when Hitler took power but did not know how far he would go. If you were going to convict these judges you would have to convict many more Germans (and where would it stop?). The Americans themselves practiced Eugenics and killed thousands and thousands of innocents at Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The one small weakness I found was that the defense never makes the simple argument that these judges were forced to do what they did just as countless others in Germany were and would have been imprisoned or killed themselves had they not complied. Anyone who's lived under a totalitarian regime may understand or at least empathize.I'm not saying I bought into these arguments or that one should be an apologist to Nazis but the fact that the film presented such a strong defense was thought provoking. How fantastic is it that Spencer Tracy plays his character the way he does – simply pursuing the facts and in a quiet thoughtful way. It's the best of humanity. How heartbreaking is Burt Lancaster's character admitting they knew admitting their guilt knowing that what happened was horrible and that they were wrong and yet seeking Tracy's understanding in that scene in the jail cell at the end – intellectual to intellectual - and being rebuked. Even a single life taken unjustly was wrong. Had the Axis won the war I don't know which Americans would have been on trial for war crimes for the fire bombings of Dresden and Tokyo or for dropping the atomic bombs but the film makes one think even for a war when things were seemingly as black and white as they could ever be. The particulars of this trial were fictionalized but it's representative of what really occurred and it transports you into events 70 years ago which seem so unreal today – and yet are so vitally important to understand and remember.,11 September 2017
Cinematic Theater Of A Remarkable Kind,"Beyond its compelling subject matter ""Judgement At Neuremberg"" revolutionizes the court room drama genre. The camera swings and swerves and dives between the lines of this exemplary Abby Mann script. Stanley Kramer conducts his orchestra of iconic stars with the precision of a Swiss watchmaker. The language barriers and the confinement of the action masterfully resolved. Spencer Tracy is simply magnificent and as per usual we believe every word that comes out of his mouth. His judge is an American monument of unsentimental humanity. Twentynine year old Maimilian Schell won the Oscar as best actor and his performance survived the test of time with the vigor of his conviction. Montgomery Cliff makes his short minutes on the screen one of those memorable moments that nobody that has ever seen it will be able to forget. The man and the character merging into one chilling shattering truth. ""I am half the man I've ever been"" Marlene Dietrich gives to her German aristocrat a legendary star quality. And Judy Garland overweight and almost unrecognizable breaks your heart and gets her last Oscar nomination. My only troubles came with the stoic Burt Lancaster because I could never forget it was Burt Lancaster and with Richard Widmark's strident prosecutor. I have seen ""Judgement At Neuremberg"" more than a dozen times and it never ceases to amaze me that no matter the darkness of the subject it always manages to entertain and inspire.",1 February 2007
"""My counsel says we were not aware of the extermination of the millions. He would give you the excuse: We were only aware of the extermination of the hundreds.""",This quote is one of the most shocking and yet truthful quotes I have ever heard. It is one of many shocking and intense quotes in the movie. Furthermore Judgment at Nuremburg is one of the most absorbing movies I have seen. Even though most if not all of it is dialog it is very much a haunting film. This film is loosely based on the trials in Nuremburg in 1948. Right from the start the movie captures your mind and never lets it go. The acting was collectively amazing. One of the best casts ever assembled which included Spencer Tracy Montgomery Clift Judy Garland Richard Widmark Burt Lancaster as well as international stars Maximilian Schell and Marlene Dietrich. It is not just the fact that this is a star studded cast that made it so great it was the way everyone appeared to blend in together. Maximilian Schell gave the performance of his life in this film playing the defense lawyer for Burt Lancaster who give two superb narratives that will certainly stay in your mind forever. Schell's character use of logic is that of something which will mesmerize use you whether or not you agree or disagree with what he says. Richard Widmark playing the prosecutor gave the type of supporting performance that was necessary for Schell to shine. The way both actors fed off each other was a joy to watch. Then of course the tiny appearances of Garland and Clift were excellent and worth every second they spent on camera. I usually find myself frustrated with cameos and actors receiving recognition for them but this film used cameos the best way I have ever seen. Then of course Spencer Tracy and Marlene Dietrich provided such great presence were perfect for the lead.The direction of Stanley Kramer was spectacular as the film intensified more and more as it wore on. It was always engrossing and never let up. The writing of Abby Mann was great filled up with great material and narratives allowing every actor in the cast to give a superb performance. There were many memorable quotes as well. The writing carried the film forward and allowed all the potential and talent to push this film to another level.Judgement at Nuremburg is not just another movie. It is a very thought provoking movie. More than that though it is haunting. Just thinking about the course of the events being talked about in the movie became subtly haunting in a way I really didn't expect. What was the most compelling though was the way we need to separate what we feel with what has to be truly done with what is truly right.,28 January 2009
Hollywood's best in an important film,It is so easy to dismiss this as a story of other people in another time in another land. Unfortunately what was done then is being done by the leaders of our country in the name of protection from terrorists and we the people sit silently by and let it happen just as the German people did seven decades ago.We need to watch films like this over and over to remind us of what is important and what we as civilized humans can be reduced to out of fear.This is another great film by the fantastic Abby Mann who died last month. He won an Oscar for his screenplay and it was well deserved.Maximilian Schell was simply fantastic as was Spencer Tracy Montgomery Clift and Judy Garland. Director Stanley Kramer brought out the best in these actors and others like Burt Lancaster Richard Widmark Marlene Dietrich William Shatner and Werner Klemperer.Don't look upon it as three hours of cinema but as a class in humanity as only Abby Mann could write.,11 April 2008
A Film Of Enduring Value,"They say that time heals all heartache. In the case of the Third Reich I'm not sure that the old saying is true. Out of respect for the Holocaust victims and as an important history lesson there's something to be said for not forgetting the evils of Hitler. Fortunately we have this great film to help us not forget.""Judgment At Nuremberg"" is a dramatization of one of the many real life post WWII Nuremberg trials of high ranking Nazis. Most of the film focuses on the 1948 courtroom trial of four judges who helped to carry out Hitler's decrees. As part of the prosecution's case against the judges real life graphic film footage showing the horrors of the death camps engenders a gut level impression that is both powerful and persuasive. The film thus educates viewers in ways that a dry textbook of facts and figures never could.But there's more to the film than the trial. In other parts of Nuremberg we see ordinary Germans trying to get on with their lives as best they can three years after the war's end in a bombed out and bleak city. One of these persons is Madame Bertholt (Marlene Dietrich) the wife of a dead German soldier. In contrast to the harsh and contentious trial Madame Bertholt's kindness toward the tribunal's lead judge Dan Haywood (Spencer Tracy) provides an example of the innocence and decency of ordinary Germans and thus adds a softer more contemplative perspective to the ordeal. In these non-courtroom scenes the melancholy background music and the soft production lighting create a mood of depression and sadness.I find very little to criticize in this three hour film. Perhaps the plot could have been clearer in identifying the legal counsel of three of the four defendants. And maybe in those scenes wherein the four defendants conversed among themselves the dialogue should have been in German not English. But these are trivial points. Overall this is a film that is well written and directed a film with credible actors giving stellar performances and most of all a film that assures preservation of that era's historic significance with a political and social message that has enduring value.",8 May 2005
The logic of evil.,"I once read a review of this film that criticized the fact that the American chief prosecutor as played by Richard Widmark was a less sympathetic and engaging character than the defending lawyer Herr Rolfe as portrayed by Max Schell. Schell's Oscar winning performance illuminated the ""shattering truth"" that the film reveals about Nazism. Extremely able and educated men were able to rationalize what they did with an irresistible logic. They loved their country and in a time of a national crisis found it necessary to implement certain measures. As expounded by Rolfe it all sounds so logical and reasonable. He also cites the fact that many world leaders actually commended Hitler upon his leadership in getting Germany out of the Depression as swiftly as he did.Widmark's character Lawson is understandably appalled by Herr Rolfe's defence of the indefencible and therefore he pulls no punches. He wants those responsible to be held fully responsible but he finds Germans who are ready to extenuate and rationalize. After he is told to tone down his demands for justice Lawson acerbically retorts ""There are no Nazis in Germany. It was those damned Eskimos."" The moment that illuminates how pure reason without humanity is so dangerous is when Pohl a right hand man for Eichman explains how it was possible to kill millions of people in purely technical terms. His explanation as he eats his lunch is devoid of any hint of human empathy for the victims he has so blithely exterminated. His was a job that was the logical extension of a policy and he carried it out with a detached and technical logic.The key point that the film makes is that to be logical is not always to be morally right.",17 June 2012
Quite grim but also very gripping,What can I say? Judgment at Nuremberg was just wonderful. At three hours it is just mesmerising from start to finish. The subject matter of the story is admittedly grim and hard-hitting but in the way it is put across and acted it is also incredibly gripping. The production values are striking Ernest Gold's music is memorable and Kramer's direction is superb. Then there is the script intelligent thought-provoking poignant quite simply a brilliant screenplay and the cast is for me one of the best on film. This film does have a lot of dignity exemplified by Burt Lancaster's thoughtful performance as Ernst Janning and a startling turn from Maximillian Schell. Marlene Dietrich is also great and I also have to mention Judy Garland's touching Irene and Montgomery Clift's Rudolph. Overall gripping and intelligent helped enormously by adept direction and acting. 10/10 Bethany Cox,23 December 2010
A True Cinematic Masterpiece,"""Judgment at Nuremberg"" is one of the great films of all time. This can be attributed to the excellent script written by Abby Mann its skillful direction by Stanley Kramer and possibly one of the greatest casts ever assembled for a motion picture.The subject trial takes place in 1948 long after the trials of the major German military generals when most people had lost interest in such proceedings. Writer Mann chose to write about the trial of German judges the people who above all should have seen the evil of Hitler and his followers coming.Assigned to the trial as Chief Judge is Dan Haywood (Spencer Tracy) a low profile justice who by his own admission was not the original or subsequent choice. The prosecutor is Col. Tad Lansing (Richard Widmark) an ""army man"" who vows to convict the four ex-German Judges. Defending the accused is Hans Rolfe (Maximillian Schell) who must convince the court that the defendants were acting only for the love of their country.Among the defendants are respected Judge Ernst Janning (Burt Lancaster) who has written several books on law accepted the world over. Lawson accuses the defendants of signing orders for the sterilization of innocent men and the execution of those who opposed to the Reich and the extermination of the jews. He puts Rudolph Peterson (Montgomery Clift) on the stand as a victim of sterilization. Rolfe manages to expose the pitiful Peterson as mentally challenged. Later Irene Hoffman (Judy Garland) is put on the stand to explain her alleged affair at the age of 16 with an elderly jew. As his coup de grace Lawson shows a film depicting the horrors of German concentration camps.In between the sessions Judge Haywood strikes up a friendship with Madame Bertholt (Marlene Dietrich) the widow of a former German general in whose former home the judge is staying. In spite of their differences they begin to grow fond of each other.The army pressures Lawson to ease up and suggests that acquittal or light sentences would best serve American interests since this was the time that the blockade of Berlin was beginning. Judge Haywood is also pressured to go easy on the sentencing.Maximillian Schell deservedly won an Oscar for his outstanding performance as Rolfe. Any one of the other principals could have easily won as well. Clift and Garland are simply outstanding as are Widmark and Lancaster. And Tracy did he ever give a bad performance? The still beautiful Dietrich was also excellent. Others in the cast are a very young William Shatner as Capt. Byers a court officer Werner Kemperer as Emil Hahn the most militant of the defendants and Ray Teal as Judge Ives. Teal had long been a fixture in westerns and is probably best remembered for playing Sheriff Coffey on TV's Bonanza.The DVD release contains an excellent conversation between Abby Mann and Maximillian Schell plus an interview with Kramer's widow the still beautiful former actress Karen Sharpe.A true cinematic masterpiece.",25 September 2004
An ageless examination of the aftermath of war,Full too the brim with more star wattage fire power than a dozen other films combined Stanley Kramer's Oscar winning courtroom epic Judgment at Nuremberg is a powerful and ageless dialogue heavy classic that remains to this day one of the best World War 2 themed films all without ever firing a single shot or even a single battle.Inspired by real life courtroom trials that came to public attention in the aftermath of the great war as Nazi members were trialed for their actions during the horrific period in Germany's history Kramer and Nuremberg's writer Abby Mann (with unofficial work from one of the films stars Montgomery Clift) spend a great deal of time exploring the after effects of the Nazi reign on Germany and how those caught up in the situation dealt with what was for all intents and purposes a hopeless situation to be a part of.Lead by a powerful performance from its main focus Spencer Tracy as aging American judge Dan Haywood (who delivers a stunning final monologue in the films later stretches) we only spend brief moments of Nuremberg's runtime outside of the sweat inducing caught room action that sees Maximillian Schell's defense lawyer Hans Rolfe go head to head with Richard Winmark's American army lawyer Col. Tad Lawson but the film never feels small or confined by its devices as we explore the mental anguish and eye opening examinations of what the war meant outside of the battlefield what it meant to those everyday people who were nothing more than pawns in a much bigger game of life and death.In this loaded ensemble we also get a memorable Burt Lancaster turn as German judge Dr. Ernst Janning with both the actors performance and characters arc making for an extremely moving examination of a good man caught in an horrific predicament while screen legends such as Marlene Dietrich Judy Garland and a very young William Shatner all deliver great turns with varying degrees of screen time ensuring Nuremberg is one of the era's most well-rounded examples of a collection of once in a generation talents.The whole production is beautifully constructed by the often underappreciated Stanley Kramer who alongside this effort and the likes of On the Beach Guess Whose Coming to Dinner comedy gem It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World and The Defiant Ones established himself as a director of true worth that may not have received the plaudits of some of his era's peers but remains a director with a fantastic catalogue of films he managed to produce in a career that will stand tall during the tests of time.Final Say -Powerful and emotion packed without the need for any theatrics Judgment at Nuremberg is one of the most stunning cinematic examples of a courtroom and World War 2 drama respectively and is a film that should continue to be adored by cinephiles for the years yet to come.5 Opa's out of 5.,20 July 2021
~One of the most Powerful Films ever made.~,Judgement At Nurmeberg is a 1961 film about four Nazi Judges are in trial for crimes against humanity. Well let me just start out by saying that this is a very sad powerful film. I was expecting it to be very boring and I guess I underestimated it. The film is also very well written so well written that actually it makes you really think. I'm happy that it won an Oscar for writing. The best quality about the film HAS to be the acting. Judy Garland I think should of won a Supporting Actress. This is her finest performance ever and I'm sad she didn't win one. Maximilian Schell gives the performance of a lifetime in his role as the defense attorney for the judges. He truly deserved his Oscar because he was very powerful. Spencer Tracy also gave a quite exceptional performance as he always had. (He isn't a Two-Time Oscar Winner for nothing. As for Montgomery Clift he deserved his Oscar Nomination. I am kind of ticked off that Marlene didn't get an Oscar Nomination for Best Supporting Actress. I always feel she is underrated.As for Stanley Kramer (The Director) he had real talent and this film shows it. The 9-Time Oscar nominated Director should've of won an Oscar for Best Director for Judgement at Nuremberg. I hope his talent though will be remembered for many years to come.My Overall Consensus is that the movie definitely succeeds due to the Extraordinary Performances and the Quite Exceptional Writing.You Should see this Film. 10/10,14 June 2010
Would a film of that candor have a chance of being made today?,"I watched ""Judgment at Nuremburg"" on PBS the other night. I had never seen it before. I expected an empty-headed Hollywood-style quasi-melodrama but I was pleasantly surprised. Even Spencer Tracy that universally beloved actor whose appeal has always escaped me gave an honest and heartfelt portrayal of a ""simple man"" who was also a deeply conflicted judge.What I liked most about this movie was that it didn't pull any punches in the manner of other ""controversial"" films of its time. The defense attorney superbly played by Maximilian Schell weaves a simple but undeniable web of logic: Sterilization of ""undesirables"" one of the charges against the Nazi war criminals was at one time condoned by the U.S. courts and encouraged by none other than Oliver Wendell Holmes. - Numerous leading industrialists in the U.S. contributed to the development of the Nazi war machine. - Encouragement was given to Hitler's expansionism by both Russia and England. - Churchill is quoted as having admired Hitler. - The Vatican actively collaborated with the Nazis.Correct me if I'm wrong but it must have taken major cojones to present that kind of message to American filmgoers in 1961. Would a film of that candor have a chance of being made today?I tend to doubt it. One further note. The film describes how the Nazis went about stripping the German judiciary of judges who were known for their objectivity and replacing them with judges who were appointed based solely on their party loyalties.The mind boggles at the implications and yes the prescience of this well-written well-played masterpiece.",30 April 2007
The Complainant At the Bar is Civilization Itself,Following a trail first started by Marty Judgment at Nuremberg is one of the first films to be taken from television. Abby Mann wrote this script for a live drama on Playhouse 90. Only Maximilian Schell and Werner Klemperer repeated their roles from the 1959 production. Others in that cast were Claude Rains as Judge Haywood and Paul Lukas as the defendant Ernest Janning.Stanley Kramer assembled a cast of some big movie names for his film and directed this film reverently as it has an eternal message. To get the film out of the Nuremberg Tribunal courtroom the role of the widow of the German general played by Marlene Dietrich was created and the other German citizens were also created show that Kramer could get some dialog in about how the ordinary German felt. In the original play their only advocate is defense lawyer Maximilian Schell.Schell is some good advocate indeed. While not lessening the guilt of any of the four German judges in the dock he does raise some disturbing questions about other societies and how very easily the slide into totalitarian brutality can happen. He also shows some of the worst aspects in German character in his cross examination of Judy Garland and Montgomery Clift.The Nuremberg Tribunal has been going on four two years now. The big Nazi fish have been dealt with and we're now trying four German judges who apparently forgot all about due process in their efforts to ingratiate themselves with the new Nazi regime. Clift and Garland are two examples of German everypeople who got caught up in it and their performances well merited Oscar nominations in the Supporting player categories.Richard Widmark is the lead prosecutor and this is probably one of the least complex roles Widmark ever played. He's identified as a New Deal liberal a protégé of the late President Roosevelt. He was in at the liberation of concentration camps and it effected him. It made him the good advocate for civilization itself.In an original cast album of the film the monologues with Burt Lancaster confessing his guilt and Spencer Tracy rendering the verdicts were included. Lancaster in a smaller way plays the part of Albert Speer who probably escaped the hangman by just throwing himself on the mercy of the court. He's the only one who shows contrition. His confession though is a textbook example of how a demagogue can come to power in a nation left without pride.Spencer Tracy and Maximilian Schell got Academy Award nominations for Best Actor with Schell winning. But Tracy's summation of the trial is devastatingly correct. The real complainant at the bar is civilization itself as he so eloquently states. No player before or since has ever done so many lengthy speeches in his films and done them so well. This is the best of them a creed for civilization that we as humans should all live by.In some of the smaller roles take note of some good performances by Virginia Christine as Tracy's housekeeper Werner Klemperer as the unrepentant Nazi judge and Howard Caine as Judy Garland's husband who does not want her victimized all over again on the witness stand. A real cross section of the German public circa 1948.Judgment at Nuremberg should be seen back to back with Schindler's List as a portrayal of the brutality itself and how civilization tried to deal with the consequences. Judgement at Nuremberg is a film whose message will never not be timely.,25 November 2006
The Hare Was Shot by the Hunter in the Bunker,"Abby Mann re-documents his stunning 1959 ""Playhouse 90"" teleplay for director Stanley Kramer with Maximilian Schell towering over a magnificent ensemble cast. The focus isn't on Nazi atrocities (though they are here in horrific images). But this being a trial drama ""Judgment at Nuremberg"" attempts to answer questions about humanity beginning with HOW? ""How could this have happened?"" And while only four mid-level Nazis receive justice the film makes you wonder Where does punishment for the Holocaust end? And if you do not stop don't you become the enemy? That wanders of course into subjective interpretation; and there are certainly others. This only makes an already strong piece of work more relevant. Criticisms about it being fictionalized and too long are curiously incongruent. Fewer people would sit through the real trials. The actors seem to employ demons (two nakedly) to give electrifying all-time greatest performances. The film is repellent and manipulative but necessarily so. It exposes guilt innocence and timeless evil.********** Judgment at Nuremberg (12/14/61) Stanley Kramer ~ Maximilian Schell Spencer Tracy Montgomery Clift Judy Garland",3 July 2010
Questions Without Answers - Which Is The History Of Nazi Germany,"Lacking the big names of what people normally think of as the ""Nuremberg Trials"" - the trial of Nazi leaders such as Goering Hess and Speer - this movie focuses on the lesser known people who were tried for war crimes: the German judges whose responsibility it was to dispense ""justice"" in Hitler's Germany. Although the big names are missing the movie is powerful and masterfully deals with the troubling questions around Nazism: how could normally good decent people (represented in this movie by Ernst Janning played by Burt Lancaster on trial with three others) have allowed themselves to be sucked into the evil that was Hitler and National Socialism? How could the German people have turned a blind eye to what was going on and simply denied all responsibility? And the movie also considers a troubling question about the United States: if Nazism was evil enough to have warranted a war and then all the effort of the Nuremberg trials why were the Americans suddenly so willing to ""forgive and forget"" with the onset of the Cold War and the threat of communism?The implication here is that the Americans never really took the secondary trials seriously. A second-rate judge (Dan Haywood available only because he had been defeated in an election and played magnificently by Spencer Tracy) was appointed to head the trial the Army was putting pressure on the prosecution to go lightly. It's an amazing fact of history that within three years of the end of World War II the feeling was so clearly against pursuing those who had played roles in the Nazi nightmare (and of course it's a question that still haunts us today as Nazi war criminals from time to time turn up and the response of the public is often ""he's an old man. Why bother?"")Focussing largely on the trial itself the movie is consistently gripping throughout and even the diversions outside the courtroom (such as the relationship between Judge Haywood and Mrs. Bertholt -Marlene Dietrich) don't detract from the suspense as they continue to push the question: ""how can you just sit there and deny knowing anything?"" Anyone with an interest in the puzzle of Nazi Germany should watch this. In the end it raises a lot of questions and offers few answers but that may be the legacy of Nazism. But the movie makes its point. As Judge Janning talks to Judge Haywood at the end of the movie he says almost pleadingly ""we never knew it would go so far."" Haywood simply responds ""Herr Janning it went that far the first time you convicted a man you knew was innocent."" Powerful stuff.10/10",3 June 2002
Magnificent film based on actual events with top-notch performances by all star cast,A stimulating portrayal of the Nuremberg trials in which members of the German judiciary were brought to response their crimes in the immediate post-war period.The movie initiates with scenes of Nuremberg Germany 1948. The destruction of the war is clear everywhere. Judge Haywood(Spencer Tracy) is driven through the rotten buildings. Judge Hayward along with two other judges (Ray Teal Kednneth Mackenna) to preside over the trial of Ministry of Justice judges and Nazi prosecutors for their complicity in Third Reich. Hayward is helped by his assistant Harrison (William Shatner). In its opening declaration  the prosecution (an excellent prosecutor played by Richard Widmark) calls these defendants to account not for violation of due process or other constitutional violations but for killings tortures and cruelties committed during WWII. The accuser statements that the accused cannot claim ignorance that they should have known better for their high position and knowledges.Defender Hans Rolfe (Maximilian Schell) counsel's opening statement he declares that the aim of this judgment is the reestablishment of the code of justice with honor and innocence because of judges don't make the laws . He argues the disobedience to the Fuehrer would have been choice between patriotism and treason for the justices with the subsequent firing squad. Finally the defending explains that not only are the judges on trial so are the German people.One of the more dramatic portions of the film centers around Judge Janning's (Burt Lancaster) performance during the Feldenstein case (in real life the Katzenberger case). Fedlenstein was charged with race mixing of having relations with an Aryan Irene Hoffman (Judy Garland). The trial was to be used as a showcase for National Socialism. Emil Hahn (Werner Kemplerer) had been the accuser and he was determined to find Feldenstein guilty despite evidence that he had merely been a family friend to Irene Hoffman. Hahn had told Irene that it was no use to deny having relations. That if she protected Feldenstein she would be arrested for perjury. She said she couldn't lie and was arrested. She said that Emil Hahn mocked Feldenstein ridiculed him. Janning had been the presiding judge and he took no action to prevent the injustice. He had been the only hope for the defense since he had a reputation for being fair. Feldenstein was found guilty and executed.Prosecutor Lawson (Richard Widmark) submitted documents by which the judges and prosecutors had sent thousands to their deaths. A film was shown  a short-documentary is based on real events by means of photographs and stock-footage. As appears work camps are transformed into extermination centers to implement the policy of genocide thought at the Wannsee Conference . At the concentration camps was some minor industrial activity linked to the war effort but the main work was the execution of inmates.Millions of prisoners died in the concentration camps through mistreatment disease starvation and overwork or were executed as unfit for labor. More than six million Jews died in them usually in gas chambers although many were killed in mass shootings and by other means . As the documentary showed a gas chamber at Dachau  but it is a mistake because of it was never used prisoners died from mistreatment or from execution by means other than gas. The archival footage shows tattooed skin  but Buchenwald prisoners with unusual tattoos were killed  then their skin was preserved for the tattoo collection of convicted war criminal Ilse Koch. Defense counsel speaks to the content of the films shown the previous day. He states that there is no justification for what happened but that it was wrong and unfair to show such films in court against these defendants. He claims that the extremists are responsible not the defendants. He says that very few Germans knew what was going on. He claimed that the defendants stayed in their positions to keep things from getting worse. The defending then calls Irene Hoffman. In this unseemly portion of the defense the defense counsel tries to portray Irene Hoffman as a law breaker and Judge Janning as merely doing his duty. The hypocrisy is evident and seems to bother even defense counsel Rolfe. Yet he continues to badger Irene trying to break her down to show that she did in fact have an affair with Feldenstein. Janning interrupts him and stops him from continuing.The next day Janning testifies about the Feldenstien case. He tells that there was fear in the country. That Hitler told the people to lift their heads. That once the gypsies Jewish and others were destroyed all would be well.Janning was content to sit by during his trial until he realized the same arguments were being used in this trial in his defense that had been used in the Feldenstien trial. Janning denies that Germans were unaware of the exterminations. He says that all were aware of what was going on maybe not the details but only because they did not want to know the details.Judge Hayward affirms the value of a single human life and the responsibility of the justices and by implication the German people for their actions and inaction. This graphic account of the Nuremberg trials were immediately brought to book and subsequently adapted by Stanley Kramer in ¨Playhouse ¨ style. Judge Haywood is perfectly played by Spencer Tracy he gives us the uneasy feeling that the German people never really came to terms with their innocence or guilty. This film takes the point of view that Germany at the time of the picture was realized was moving beyond the war a little too fast and was doing so with the help of the US and other allies because of the Cold War. For his passionated acting of the defending advocate Maximilian Schell won an Oscar as the years's best player and special mention Montgomery Clif also uncredited as screenwriter. Rating : Excellent better than average.,20 April 2010
Probably one of the most important films of the 1960s...still highly relevant...,JUDGMENT AT NUREMBERG was adapted from Abby Mann's TV play and turned into a masterful piece of work by director Stanley Kramer. His sterling cast included SPENCER TRACY and RICHARD WIDMARK (American judge and prosecutor respectively) German defense attorney MAXIMILIAN SCHELL in his award-winning Best Actor role and such impressive defendants as MARLENE DIETRICH JUDY GARLAND and MONTGOMERY CLIFT all giving deeply felt performances.As every student of history knows there were trials after World War II held in Nuremberg Germany for Nazis who committed crimes against humanity during the war. This story concerns some fictional German defendants who were more like second tier when it came to atrocities committed since the primary leaders had already been judged. Nevertheless their part in the war crimes is investigated as the trial proceeds to occupy most of the film giving the whole story a claustrophobic feeling the kind one always gets from a real-life courtroom setting.Tracy has some marvelous speeches to make--and Maximilian Schell has his moments where the viewpoint of an intelligent German defense attorney is seen as opposed to the violently opposite statements of RICHARD WIDMARK as the American prosecutor. The audience is forced to view both viewpoints and having heard all the evidence presented make up its own mind as to the outcome.It's an important film historically and one can certainly understand why so many of the actors were honored with Academy Award nominations or winners of Golden Globes. They all play an important part in keeping the film grounded in reality and not given to melodramatic outbursts.Summing up: Honest and thought-provoking it serves as a valuable history lesson as well as a solid piece of entertainment.,26 August 2006
A sickening truth A story needed to be told.,At the end of the Second World War in 1945 the world was dealt the final blow with the discovery and liberation of the Nazi death camps.The human race who had already faced up to and who had become hardened to nearly six years of murder and violence found this level of barbarity and cruelty unlike anything the world had witnessed before or since.For four years after the war the heads of the former Nazi state were gathered and put on trial for their crimes. This film tells the story of these trials at Nuremberg.Richard Widmark plays an American army officer one of the unfortunate few who marched in to liberate a concentration camp and was sickened by what he saw a man who is now hell bent on prosecuting the culprits and bringing them to justice.Spencer Tracy without doubt one of the greatest screen actors of all time plays Judge Haywood the man who is to sit in judgement over the proceedingsa man trying to remain impartial despite his own personal views of disgust and hatred.Burt Lancaster in probably his finest performance plays Dr. Ernst Janning a former German lawyer a man who had worked for the Nazis and had been responsible for sending many innocent men to their deaths in the interests of Hitler's Reich. A man now eaten away by his inner torment and feelings of guilt. A man who is now on trial for his own life just as his victims had once been on trial for theirs.Maximillian Schell deservedly won an Oscar for his portrayal of Hans Rolfe the German defence lawyer trying to defend these men he knows are guilty while at the same time trying to salvage some threads of dignity for the people of his defeated and war battered nation.Other notable performances come from Judy Garland who showed us what a fine dramatic actress she could be when give the opportunity and Marlene Deitrich as the widow of an already executed German officer...both performances especially that of Garland were in my opinion Oscar winning level.It is however Lancaster's performance which gripped me most. He takes the stand against Rolfe's advice and speaks to the court of his crimes his guilt and his repentance.He says that for the German people to rebuild their self respect then they need to face up to the terrible things they have done. He lays mention to the fact that most Germans are saying that they didn't know of the death camps and his speech is both heartfelt and moving.'When train loads of women and children past through our towns crammed in like cattle on the way to their extermination.....were we blind? When we heard those children crying out to us in the night and did nothing to help them....were we deaf? We didn't know because we didn't WANT to know.' He mentions how he thought Nazism was a good thing in the beginning but how he had become too heavily involved and was too scared to back out once he realised the levels to which it had risen.A poignant speech and one that still leaves a lump in my throat.Spencer Tracy has the most accurate and thought provoking line in the whole movie.Jannings tells Haywood that he was shocked and appalled at the figure of six million victims....he explains how he never knew it would go that far.Spence looks down at his shoes and says with neither hatred or kindness 'It went that far the first time you ever sentenced someone to death whom you knew was innocent.' A truer word could not have been spoken.It is my belief that every person in the entire world should be made to watch two movies as part of their education of life. Schindlers List and Judgement at Nuremberg. In no other film has the horrific and sickening crimes of the Nazis been described or portrayed more vividly or graphically as in these two productions.It is only by keeping this fresh in the mind of future generations can we ensure it can never happen again.,17 February 2005
A Considered Film,A story with no winners presented in an earnest fashion that makes the audience really question both perspectives being portrayed.For its time its quite unrelenting and brutal.The film questions humanity in a most brilliant way.Feels similar to 12 Angry Men but much more significant.Quite something :),23 January 2022
A Very Interesting & Well-Crafted Look at a Difficult Subject,"This is a very interesting well-crafted and thought-provoking look at a difficult subject from a difficult period in world history. It recreates the complex feelings and issues of the era with care and it goes out of its way to be fair to all of the characters and what they stand for.Between the difficult decisions involved in determining responsibility for the outrages that took place under the Nazi regime and the diplomatic worries of the era there is a lot of emotionally charged material and yet ""Judgment at Nuremberg"" uses an excellent cast and well-conceived characters to create a movie that is both worthwhile for its themes and interesting to watch.The characters are well-chosen so as to allow the opportunity for each major perspective to have a hearing and the cast members do quite well in bringing their characters to life. Spencer Tracy gives one of his finest performances as the judge in the center of it all. Very few other actors could have been so believable in portraying the character as he carefully weighs so many different viewpoints knowing that he must come to a decision.Burt Lancaster is very effective as the most interesting of the defendants and the one whose case is the hardest to evaluate. His character is contrasted effectively with the other defendants and Lancaster makes the character interesting and his case significant. Maximilian Schell also succeeds in a challenging role. Marlene Dietrich works well in her role which represents yet another aspect of the general situation. The other characters likewise all have a purpose and are all portrayed believably with Montgomery Clift and Judy Garland in particular standing out as two traumatized witnesses.Even within the lengthy running time it would not be possible to cover every significant point involved in the discussion. But this dramatization is one of the best depictions available of the dilemmas and challenges that had to be faced in the aftermath of the Second World War.",20 January 2005
One of the most thrilling and thought provoking movie of all times,I have always been fond of Stanley Kramer's work  but this movie proved to be quite extraordinary and exceptional .The movie has every thing you can desire and human sentiments are at there level best. The plot is written by Abby Mann who won best screenplay Oscar from that and quite deserving one. The story based on Nuremberg trials held after fall of Nazi's in Germany but this movie is nice blend of history with fiction as the major characters were fictional but the evidences and indictments presented in the trial ever authentic and truly depicts the conditions of Nazi occupied Germany. The most intriguing thing of the movie was the true representation of aftermaths of Nazi's occupation in Germany and the feeling of German toward the trial and immaculate direction of Kramer made possible to convey these types of sentiment on cinema for the very first time. The cast was also fascinating with big names like Tracy and surely he did justice with his role as he was very compelling and humble as Judge Haywood. Maximilian Schell was at his best as a compassionate enthusiastic zealous and patriotic attorney to defend the dignity of Nation. He won best actor Oscar for his role. Montgomery Clift was also the one who made this movie special as he played a role of feeble minded sterile man who was nominated for best actor in supporting role though he only played for 9 min in the movie. Burt Lancaster gave one of the most extraordinary cinematic performances as Ernst Janning. This is one of those movies which provokes our mentality and also our morality and is a treat to watch.,9 October 2006
They don't make films like this any more -- and it's entirely our loss,"This 1961 film is just about as close to timeless in its impact as you can get in its searing treatment of the universal themes of law justice and humanity. This far downstream it's worth recalling that the movie was made just 15 years after the end of WWII when the aftermath of the war was still reverberating. It's set during the ""Nuremberg Trials"" of 1947-49 during which high-ranking German generals judges politicians and others responsible for the atrocities of the Nazi regime were tried against still-evolving standards of international law. The movie takes us through just one of these the trial of four high-placed judges and I was actually surprised to learn that there was an earlier much shorter version of this drama shown 2 years earlier on the prestigious old TV series Playhouse 90. But the movie carries a wallop that no TV show could have given.I had to check the history to be sure but though the bare bones of the time place and setting are accurate all the characters and details are entirely fictional. I think maybe this was the correct choice because it could allow the script to concentrate entirely on two major themes in its 3-hour run time: first and foremost the courtroom drama and second a look into German postwar society when most were desperate to forget and try to get back to normal living. The side plot is kind of disposable -- some of those scenes drag -- but the courtroom scenes that are the spine of the movie are intense claustrophobic and utterly absorbing. Because of the imbalance of the two parts of the story I rate this as ""only"" 9/10 but my bottom-line message is simply to see it any way you can. There is lots here that resonates with what is happening now all around us.The cast is flat-out astonishing: Spencer Tracy Maximilian Schell Richard Widmark Marlene Dietrich Judy Garland Burt Lancaster Montgomery Clift. None of these giants are still with us but if you want to see what the classic Hollywood stars were capable of this is just about the best place to go. (Schell won the Best Actor Oscar for this which is hard to argue with once you see him work.) Each one of these multiple leads has at least one powerhouse scene -- always in the courtroom where all of the true interest of the film takes place -- that is guaranteed to stick in your mind. Tracy and Widmark were in lots and lots of movies and they tended to play every role in much the same way: Tracy played the aw-shucks average guy you could imagine as a next-door neighbor Widmark always seemed to have that flat delivery with an edge of menace -- but here they stretch themselves. Widmark's narration of the horrors revealed in the concentration camps (which in the setting of the film were uncovered just two years before) accompanied by hard-to-watch film records is impressively spare and restrained and Tracy as the leading tribunal judge gives a summation speech that has real weight.Even among all these leads however Burt Lancaster stands out. Playing a respected and even renowned German judge who inexplicably stepped into the dark side late in the film he delivers a long uninterrupted testimony that is electrifying. Up till that point he had been only a looming Presence lurking at the edge of the proceedings but he is the key defendant everyone mentions repeatedly. When will he speak? What will he say? The dramatic tension pays off handsomely. Lancaster was an amazingly physical kind of actor and by that I don't mean just physique or action-hero roles. But the camera is drawn to him in a way that is hard to explain: he can get your attention just by standing up from a chair. I think much of it is due to a kind of stillness of posture an utter spareness of movement. I can't think of a single modern actor like that.It's fun to note that one of the supporting actors in this stellar cast who IS still with us is William Shatner. As the military aide to Judge Haywood (Tracy) he's there from beginning to end and he does very nicely. Several years later he'd move on to become Captain Kirk.Maybe understandably for the time all the speaking roles for the ""German"" characters except for Maximilian Schell and Marlene Dietrich were played by Americans with fake mild accents. Today that wouldn't work . I'm visualizing a re-mounting of this piece with a true international cast but I'm not sure anyone wants to revisit the Nazi era in quite so unsparing a way.",23 May 2021
there are several things to consider,"Stanley Kramer's ""Judgment at Nuremberg"" is one of the most intense courtroom movies ever. Focusing on the Nazi trials after WWII it shows how the prosecution sought to remind people that complicity extended to every segment of the population. Indeed there were people in the courtroom who thought that Germany should forget about what happened and just move on but the prosecution reminded everyone that forgetting about what happened could lead to a repeat of the atrocities.There is also a scene that is of particular interest to me. The defense attorney (Maximilian Schell in an Academy Award-winning role) notes that it was not only Germany that was responsible for the Nazis' crimes against humanity. There was the Vatican's Reichskonkordat the Soviet Union's treaty with Germany setting the stage for the latter's invasion of Poland and there were a number of US corporations supporting Hitler. In other words many different countries abetted the Nazis actions as much as the German citizens did.This is probably one of the most important movies ever made. It reminds us that justice might not move quickly but must eventually come. Aside from Spencer Tracy Burt Lancaster and Richard Widmark in the top roles we also have Marlene Dietrich Judy Garland and Montgomery Clift in supporting roles as well as early appearances of William Shatner and Werner Klemperer.Everyone should see it.",25 November 2017
When films like this can be made.......,If this is not considered as one of THE great films of all time then all of us film fans should pack up bags and go home I cannot fault anyone any scene anything in this film. The dialogue races along in its smooth yet supremely captivating style. You grab a film like this see a whole host of famous actors and wonder if such a mix could ever work. It does believe me it really really does.Tracy. He was given the most powerful of dialogues he presents it to us in a way that does not shout at you yet holds you in a vice like grip every time he comes on screen. With his characteristic method of looking down whilst talking hands in pocket that small sly look up that he does vintage Spencer just how you would imagine a judge to be or should be.The supporting cast again never lets the film down. Some have the opportunity to step up a notch Snell Widmark and others play their roles in a more subtle manner Garland and Dietrich. And others just wipe away the floor with their presence Clift and Lancaster for example.And the story by Abby Mann - incredible.Shot in black and white it makes you think it makes you smile it will make you sad and in the end you will be all the better for having seen one of the greatest films ever made you will be richer for the experience and you will be wiser.You will also be able to say that you saw what Hollywood can do you saw what great actors can do when put amongst their peers and are not 'stars' of a movie but are part of a larger ensemble.And you will also see why this particular group were genuinely the very best Hollywood had to offer period.,6 October 2005
It's currently #160 and has quite a few reviews already...,"""Judgment at Nuremberg"" is a great film and its current rank of #160 is indicative of its greatness. And it has quite a few reviews already so I don't intend to write an exhaustive review. Bkoganbing from Buffalo has already written a very nice review explaining the background for the movie that I might normally discuss so in order not to be so repetitive and dull I'll just be brief.The film is about one particular set of trials that followed the end of WWII. It is not THE trial--just one of many. Unlike the well publicized early trials of the obviously evil (most of which were hanged) many other sets of trials followed. In this case four jurists who knew better but complied with the Nazis are on trial. To learn about the rest of the trials and the outcomes do an internet search-- it's out there and I've read about the other trials. But this one is a fictionalization of the actual Nuremberg trials of these jurists and it has a lot to offer.First the acting is absolutely superb. The film is filled with great actors who were great at seeming natural. Oddly Maximillian Schell got the Oscar among these other greats and his performance was quite different--extremely florid and loud. I preferred the quieter parts played by Spencer Tracy Marlene Dietrich* Burt Lancaster and others. I think Montgomery Clift and Judy Garland were also quite good--mostly because they were emotional wrecks off-screen as well and they seemed to tap into this (particularly Garland). Regardless you can't find movies with a better cast. Second Abby Mann's script is exceptional and you can easily see how Mann took home an Oscar. And the great camera-work and direction made his script seem all the better.Third the film faces the Nazi atrocities without flinching AND poses a question most films about the Holocaust rarely pose--about guilt of the common man as well as the leaders. Not the obvious leaders like Hitler Himmler and the like but everyone else.Overall a very very impressive film from start to finish.",29 April 2014
Revelation of Horror,"This is a fine film by a fine director but I can only hope that Stanley Kramer in committing to full length film a television story knew at heart the message his movie was trying to say. Because this is truly a message movie for all mankind but if the reviews I've read on this site are any indication the message has been lost to some degree.I've entitled my review ""Revelation of Horror"" but the horror revealed was not the Holocaust. That had already been revealed although Kramer's film certainly lent its emotional impact. The revelation was a deep true insight into how it happened and the horror is that it happened in a civilized country. Few on this earth can imagine the true horror of Nazi Germany--I've read criticism of Widmark's Colonel Lawson as too preachy but the character and the acting conveyed the mission of one who actually saw the horrors beyond any scope we can identify with.Kramer's achievement is that everything in this movie reminds us that the Nazi's used every facet of civilization no matter how minute to foster their extermination of their enemies to inculcate it as an ordinary part of life. That was why judges were chosen to portray the issue of ""obeying orders"" versus ""human decency."" Herr Rolf is ""forced"" to defend the worst criminals imaginable and yet his very defense and the principles behind it are abused in the process used as a weapon against the very law they represent. Thus did the Nazis prevail with the willing acquiescence of the German people and the abominable disregard of the rest of the world.The other horror revealed in this film is the incessant excusing of it. Beyond the obvious pleas of the guilty (""We didn't know"" or as one judge says to another ""Was it possible to kill like that?"") are the multiplicity of subtle excuses: the reminder of centuries' old German culture Rolf's plaintive cry of ""unfairness"" at the showing of the death camp films because of their inflammatory nature the invocation of ""Lili Marlene"" throughout the film to name just a few. While the song evokes sadness a guilty German society meant for it to invoke sadness. Long before Germany had its country destroyed by bombs it had its soul destroyed by Hitler.Because this is a courtroom drama respecting the sacred role of the Rule of Law in safeguarding humanity almost every scene every line is a statement that Nazi Germany perverted the Rule of Law as did the very defense of the war criminals. But what is principle on a small scale of a single man being judged by society becomes outrage when used to defend the indefensible on an impossibly massive scale. Tracy's character at the film's end has a realization that this is so as well as an awareness that what happened in Germany during the Third Reich was an Aristotelian tragedy for anyone touched by it even remotely so that any personal considerations (such as Mrs. Berthold) are made utterly impossible.Rolf's speech about the guilty responsibility of the rest of the world was valid--but he was indicting the world to save one man. Where have we heard that in our own time? This quality about ""Judgment at Nuremburg"" makes its message forever fresh--and its warnings.",25 February 2001

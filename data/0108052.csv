A three hour film that feels too short,"This film tells the story of Nazi officer Oskar Schindler who secretly saved hundreds of Jewish people from concentration camps.I have wanted to watch ""Schindler's List"" for years but could not bring myself to do so because I don't want to be disappointed. ""Schindler's List"" is phenomenally powerful and effective in portraying the historical atrocities. I believe no one can keep their eyes dry from Schindler's List"". The scene involving mothers running after trucks of children is particularly memorable. The final farewell scene is very emotional for me. It is rare achievement but ""Schindler's List"" is a three hour film that feels too short.",19 October 2009
Awesome,"The movie started out pretty innocently and for the first 20 minutes I was wondering where the movie was going. Then it started to happen. The horrible cruelty of concentration camps. Oskar Schindler is an example of a man that no matter what the situation there are people who won't go along with the cruelty of society. I'm sure it took courage to do what he did because one wrong move and you'll be dead.Movie brought to life this great man who really shouldn't be forgotten and thanks to Steven Spielberg I think he'll be remembered for generations to come. Movie like this should be made once in a while. Not that movie should be used for evangelistic purposes but some story should be told well and movie is still the best vehicle to do so.I still think that Oskar Shindler's last words in this movie was one of the best dialog in movie history - ""Why did I keep this badge ? I could have saved a person. Why did I keep this car ? I could have saved five more people.""",17 October 2005
Bring me the heads of Hitler Himmler Eichmann n Mengele.,Schindler's List is undoubtedly the best Holocaust film ever made. There just isn't anything like this film. Various other films have tried to show the true horrors of the Holocaust but none of them succeeded the way that Schindler's List did. Schindler's List is a difficult film to watch. When you see the true atrocities of the Holocaust your jaw drops. When you see the pain that all of the innocent people were going through the only thing you can do is cry. The true goal of all Holocaust films is to make you feel sorrowful and Schindler's List did that to me. If you want to see the best depiction of the Holocaust make your way towards Schindler's List. Me n my kids cried during the pit scene.,9 September 2013
Whoever saves one life saves the world entirely. ‚≠ê,"As you may know there is lots of World War II movies. Some of them shows you the worst parts of war this one is doing something better.Shows you the war is bad for everyone. Shows you een the little kindness is the greatest thing. Shows you ""Whoever saves one life saves the world entirely.""I saw so many World War II movies non of them gave me these feelings. Most of them are just too sided with USA. Some of them just made with fictional characters. And I don't know how but some of them says war is a good thing if you're shooting bad people.Besides one of the greatest historical Screenplay the Acting Performances just superb. I don't imagine any better casting for any character. They all chosen well. With Liam Neeson's Schindler Ben Kingsley's Stern and the great villain Ralp Fiennes' Amon Goth.Scores is the soul of the movie. John Williams mades you feel that.Cinematography is too great watching this movie with these colors makes the movie too much realistic. I don't know how is it doing that. I know some of the movies are trying that when flashback scenes are coming but most of them are not being successful at.Art Direction and Set Decoration is also too varied. They managed to do an enormous job. You feel the greatness in the movie with varied places and objects.",2 March 2023
What he hell is wrong with the people that commented on the 1st 4 pages of reviews???,To all the ppl on the 1st four review pages u r all idiots... To say that this movie's overrated and one sided makes u all seem naive. This is an emotional movie that emphasizes one of the worst periods in the history of mankind. I'm a big list person so anytime there's a list of the 10 20 50 best(fill in the blank) I must check it out. Now usually I'll take a gander at something jus so I can try to understand y it's considered great: 2 in particular I'm not a fan of include Pulp Fiction and Annie Hall. But I digress this movie was well worth the years it took me to finally watch had it on the DVR since March. All of the acting is absolutely stellar. I would say I hope an amazing story told on celluloid would encourage people to treat one another better but given the state of things in parts of the world I'll say we're a long way from that. ONE OF THE MOST GUT WRENCHING MOVIES I'VE EVER SEEN,16 August 2017
A SINGULAR ACHIEVEMENT,I have only ever seen this film once I only ever want to see this film once and I will only ever need to see this film once. It is etched on my mind. I like many others left in silence. I could not imagine inventing a critical analysis of this film picking small points of detail or of style or even scoring points off the Director. It stands alone as a monumental piece of cinema a magnificent accomplishment.,11 December 2000
The most shattering film of all time.,I've seen this film one time in 1994. This is one of the best movies ever made but many scenes of the film are so brutal that I'm afraid to see this film for a second time.,29 September 1998
You don't have to be Jewish to be touched by this response to inhumanity.,"History has proved that the old saying ""God makes mad first whom he intends to destroy"" and in the case of Nazi Ralph Fiennes in this Steven Spielberg masterpiece that is oh so true. Unfortunately a lot of innocent people have to pay for that madness in the meanwhile and that truly adds to the intensity of his madness as it increases and his vileness just gets more and more out of control.On the other end of the spectrum is Liam Neeson's Oscar Schindler a businessman who knows by allowing the Nazis to take his Jewish workers away his productivity will suffer. Selfish motives keep these innocent people from being sent to the death camps and as Schindler learns the truth about the atrocities going on and becomes closer to the people who work very hard for him he goes out of his way to keep the Nazis from going through with their evil plans.The atrocities you see here are things we can't fathom here in America. Innocent children are forced to hide in human waste to avoid discovery. An innocent woman prisoner with a background in architecture is brutally murdered after insisting that a building being constructed is doomed to collapse after which the evil Fiennes simply orders his men to do what she suggested. Fiennes picks targets and guns them down and also has Schindler's aged workers killed simply because he considers them too old to contribute. An innocent young girl in a red coat (the only color in this black and white movie) wanders around Warsaw as the ghetto is destroyed. Neeson almost looses his right-hand man (a magnificent Ben Kingsley) because of a paperwork mix-up. This culminates in the most daring of escapes from Nazi persecution and that is where Neeson realizes the full effect of what's going on breaking down in a scene that will have you shivering in your seat.I can't watch these movies without the temptation to scream at the Nazis on screen. Even in the most outlandish propaganda films of the war era I tended to either applaud loudly or scream in delight ""Die Nazi Die!"" as the villain gets their come-uppance either through brutal murder or the firing squad after a lengthy trial revealed their shame. Many of those times my body was shaking so violently as sobs emerged from me that I was unaware I was capable of. You can't call these feelings manipulation by the direction; Spielberg obviously felt a passion for the story he was telling as if he knows that this can cross over into any race any culture any religion.Rarely in recent movie history has it been so obvious when a film was released that it would sweep the Academy Awards and ""Schindler's List"" truly deserved every honor which it received. Some stories are so painful that you can't go back and watch them easily; I find that every so often I need a movie like ""Schindler's List"" to remind me of how vile humanity can be and how one compassionate human being can change the course of history for so many. The finale with real-life ""Schindler Jews"" honoring their hero is truly awe inspiring and is certainly what you can call triumph over tragedy.",29 August 2014
Spielberg's most important work,Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson) is a social climbing opportunistic womanizing German businessman. He charms important Nazis and gets access to limitless Jewish labor. He gets Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley) as his right hand man and Jewish money to pay for his business. He provides the front. Using black market deals and advantageous connections he becomes rich and powerful. Stern works tirelessly to save people. Even as the Jews are rounded up to Plaszow labor camp under the command of unstable Amon Goeth (Ralph Fiennes) Schindler is able to befriend the mad commander.This is probably the most important movie of director Steven Spielberg's career. At least it's the most important for him. Based on the true story Spielberg uses all his movie making skills to create this iconic movie. The black and white provides starkness and thankfully a little bit of distance from the horrible events. Liam Neeson and Ben Kingsley are the perfect duo. Ralph Fiennes gives a complex performance as the mad commander. The shock of the horrors of the Holocaust is expertly done. When I first saw it in the theater I couldn't help sob a little when Schindler breaks down at the end.,23 March 2014
Stunning - Spielberg's Greatest Film & Top üíØ All Time Best,"Leaves one speechless - Moving somber and horrifying. One of Humankind's worst moments - Something no one should ever forget.This is filmmaking at its finest. Even with 7 Oscars deserved more. On par with the greatest films ever made. Certainly cemented Steven as one of the greatest filmmakers to walk the planet. A personal labor by Steven it is clearly something he felt compelled to do and it shows in the intricate detail of every scene.""Schindler's List"" is nearly flawless in every category. A must-see film for reasons beyond entertainment.üôè",10 April 2022
Profound Beauty! If you appreciate art this is a masterpiece.,SCHINDLERS LIST is Jewel.Evil and indifference we see all around us every day. And there are times when goodness is as rare as lamplight in a howling storm ‚Äì Michael Wilmington 93'The brutal realism of WWII countless crimes against humanity and the darkest journey imaginable is breathed into life in this epic adaptation based on the true story of Oskar Schindler. Directed by renowned veteran director Steven Spielberg this story of morbid ethnic cleansing is of timeless learning for generations to come. Starring Liam Neeson as Oskar Schindler Ben Kinglsey as Itzhak Stern & Ralph Fiennes as Amon Goeth there isn't a moment of distraction from the matters at hand. Oskar Schindler an industrialist and an obvious opportunist acquires an enamelware factory in Krakow employing Jews from concentration camps in the region. Hounding prisoners to invest in his industrial venture as he reaps the financial benefits whilst the Jewish investors are paid their returns in metal ware. As the war comes with the Germany losing the SS begins moving its prisoners Westward to remaining camps. Oskar Schindler invests heavily on Jewish workforce by bribing the SS for his own interest. As time passes his interests were in-tuned with the well being of his workforce than himself strident towards bankruptcy.Performances that are brutally surreal and engrossing will break you down whilst certain artistry of hand held cinematography will place you in the midst of all chaos and tragedy. Shot in black and white with certain exceptions of the odd girl in the red coat for personification the realism of the morbid drama of the holocaust will never leave the audiences' mind. Up until 1993 Spielberg although is renowned for his creativity behind the camera certainly has not dealt with a screen play with such delicate baggage. A slip of the slightest would have this historical drama crawling gaping for life at the mercy of its 195 minutes of runtime. Never is it so. With CGI at its minimal and the concentration on the subject and the subjects' woe within the subject is where Spielbergs' heart is at. Enigmatic is where I am left as the end credits roll up embracing me with its moving score.What took me so long to watch this? Is something I keep asking my self now. Profound Beauty! If you appreciate art this is a masterpiece.TITLE: SCHINDLERS LIST DIRECTED BY: STEVEN SPIELBERG STARRING: LIAM NEESON BEN KINGSLEY & RALPH FIENNES RATED:R RATING: 09/10 RUNTIME: 195 Minutes,29 June 2016
Based on a true story,Schindler's List is one of the most critically acclaimed films in the 1990s. This Steven Spielberg historical movie based on the life of Oskar Schindler an ethnic German businessman who saved the lives of more than a thousand mostly Polish-Jewish refugees during the Holocaust by employing them in his factories. For Stern a job in a war-related plant could mean survival for himself and the other Jews working. ----Yidioo my name and site,20 June 2017
One of the best movies ever made.,Businessman Oskar Schindler saved the lives of many Jews by employing them in his factories this saving them from going to The Concentration Camps.This was and will forever be one of the best films ever made not just the ultimate story of The Holocaust but truly as masterpiece one of the best.If you can sit through it without being moved to the point of tears you're made of stronger stuff than I am the atrocities committed on those innocent people will never be forgotten. The realisation here is chilling.The film's pacing is quite remarkable it's a three hour film that flashes by quickly but it's three hours that will live with you forever some of the scenes will rightly never be forgotten.What has always struck me is the way that everything became normalised people first losing their businesses their homes their freedom and ultimately their lives it is truly one of the bleakest points in human history that's what this film details perfectly.The Cinematography is incredible it's understated but perfect fits the film perfectly the sheer scale of it is so impressive. The scene with the little girl in the red coat has always been one of the standout moments.No wonder it won a string of Oscars the acting is outstanding throughout I have always regarded this is Liam Neeson's best ever performance but Ben Kingsley and Ralph Fiennes are remarkable also.It's a film that informs moves and makes you think in equal measures. If you think it's going to be too much I'd say this it is very upsetting at times but it does also give some real glimpses of hope the remarkable human spirit.A jaw dropping powerful movie it's one of the best ever made.10/10.,26 January 2023
Incredibly moving and visually disturbing Spielburg's best by far!,Some of Schindler's List is very disturbing indeed with very graphic images on the screen. I thought this film is outstanding. True it is very long but the Holocaust was a very long and epic event and the movie needed a long length to convey the harsh realities of the Nazi's treatment of the Jews. The cinematography was truly excellent and some of the close ups of people being tortured or dying was enough to make you look away. The direction was taut and focused most Spielburg's movies are good but don't quite always have an impact on the whole audience. Schindler's List is visually disturbing and incredibly moving and because of this this is definitely Spielburg's best. The acting was phenomenal. Both Liam Neeson and Ben Kingsley give superb performances and Ralph Fiennes is also very chilling in his role. The music by John Williams is not only haunting but also unbearably sad believe me I was in tears for a lot of this movie. All in all a truly moving film that deserves a 10/10. Bethany Cox.,4 June 2009
"""The list is an absolute good the list is life...""","Probably the most powerful and important film one can watch in this or any lifetime. The Nazi atrocity is presented in stark images of horror beyond comprehension and even the power of one's own imagination. The scene that brought that all home to me was the one in which the young Jewish boy made his way down into the latrine to escape the nightmare of separation from his family only to find others had beaten him to it. Such desperation such will to survival.Liam Neeson Ben Kingsley and Ralph Fiennes are superb in their respective roles. The filming in black and white is only appropriate for an era of history devoid of color. Amon Goeth (Fiennes) crystallizes the Nazi sentiment toward an entire race with one line to Helen Hirsch (Embeth Davidtz) - ""I realize that you're not a person in the strictest sense of the word"".""Schindler's List"" is hardly the type of film one can consider a favorite it's reach goes far beyond entertainment. It deserves it's recognition as one of the best films of all time it's power resides in giving literal interpretation to the message 'never again'.",18 October 2006
fabulous should save in movies history,"""The List Is Life""I am speechless I am speechless.....The greatest one-part movie of my life10000000/10soooo deeply touchingall human beings must see this masterpiece.",10 February 2022
It's About Our Humanity,We need to look at a work of art like this to see ourselves in this movie. This is the result of a regime that no longer saw the worth of the human being. It politicize life. This leads to monstrous treatment of people (because they are not people in their eyes). I saw this film the first week it came out. We were on vacation on Hilton Head Island in South Carolina. I remember my wife and I not being able to talk for almost 15 minutes after it was over and then we needed to talk about something else. There are few experiences that can do that to someone. Since that time I've had many others tell me the same thing. Why is this movie so much more effective than other Holocaust films. First of all there's something personal about it. We get to know the people even the bad guys. Secondly the recreation of the death camps is so accurate. Then there is a spot of genius the little girl in the red coat. If anyone wants to complain about black and white watch this film. We get to see what can be done with shades and shadows. The work of Schindler is the work of the heart against great odds. The scene at the end when the holocaust survivors visit the graveyard is what moves the film. I think that everyone should see this film at some time. Then sit down and think about what is being done to people here in our own country.,28 March 2006
Spielberg at his best,Steven Spielberg's Schindler's List tells what the holocaust was really like from the perspective of the Jewish people when they got sent into the concentration camps until a man named Oskar Schindler saves them from the concentration camps. Schindler is played by Liam Neeson who gives the best performance of his career as a true real life hero for the German people even though he was a member of the Nazi party in real life. What Spielberg tries to prove with this movie is that he is not only capable of making swashbuckling epics like Raiders of the Lost Ark or Science fiction classics like E.T Minority Report Close Encounter of the Third Kind or Hitchcockian thrillers like Jaws but what he did with this movie is that he set a new movie genre to his movie-making vocabulary that got Oscar buzz as soon as it came out into theaters and was a total smash at the box office. Also not only Liam Neeson gives the best performance of his career but so does Ralph Fiennes who plays a Nazi soldier named Amon Goeth a soldier who five no mercy at all. In order for Schindler to save the Jews from getting persecuted what he does is that the talks to his accountant named Itzhak Stern (played by Ben Kingsley) into making a list of the names of the 1200 Jewish people that he has to save. This was a remarkable movie that will stay in my memory for as long as i live and what a masterpiece Spielberg has created.,16 May 2014
Devastating,The Holocaust is a dark and touchy subject for many. Many believed it never happened despite meticulous records kept by the Nazis themselves. Those who lived through it were scarred forever and even now can barely bring themselves to discuss its horrors. Despite the controversy around the event there is one thing for certain Steven Spielberg created a masterpiece with Schindler's List. It is a film that will find no equal in terms of bleak crushing drama. It sets out what it intends to do marvelously and leaves the viewer emotionally drained and questioning humanity itself.The film is in black and white a very conscious choice by the director that makes the subject matter already disturbing even more so bleak and harrowing. Oskar Schindler is known for saving thousands of Jews destined for a grim fate during World War 2. The movie depicts concentration camp life is fairly dismal with constant brutal oppression by Nazi camp guards and the sadistic Amon Goth with a terrifying portrayal by Ralph Fiennes.Yes this film will not make you cheery or happy. Yes it is about a miserable and dark period in human history but it is an important film to watch for anyone interested in this historic subject matter and also a beautiful work of art for film lovers. Truly one of Spielberg's finest works. The fact that he is Jewish himself does add a personal touch to the tragic tale but he never tries to overdo the sympathy or antipathy towards any group in the film.Everyone is human in this film the Jews and the Nazis; the tragedy is that humanity itself failed during this period of history and we will never forget.,23 October 2017
Best Movie of all Time,Perfect. Perfect on every level from the acting to the script to the cinematography everything about this movie is 100% perfect. I've watched this movie 3 times and there's nothing I would change. Even the insanely long running time of 3 hours and 15 minutes isn't a bad thing. Every scene feels important. I would highly recommend watching this movie. Although it is very violent and very heartbreaking so be warned!! But if you can handle strong violence and a difficult subject matter such as the Holocaust then you must see it. It's my favorite movie and I hope it will one day become yours too.Rating: 10/10,5 June 2012
Eye opening,This movie Schindler's List is hands-down without a doubt one of the greatest films I have ever had the pleasure of viewing. Regardless of how much praise I include in my review I should still think it deserves more. Few movies are actually able to pull tears out of my stubborn eyes and the two that come right to mind are this one and It's a Wonderful Life. Schindler's List is a grim portrayal of events in the Holocaust while at the same time actually bringing light to some of the humanity still there. I was embarrassed when I actually started clapping in that classroom where I first watched this movie. I'd recommend it to anybody and it remains in my top selection of movies. Outstanding.,20 November 2011
Color Choice = Genius,"'Schindler's List' is one of the most important illuminating admirable and beautiful films ever made. It is also one of the most enigmatic unnerving and demoralizing ones ever made. This makes for a most interesting combination. What this translated into for me was that it took me several viewings to finish the film finding it necessary to pause to recollect my thoughts both wishing to remember emotionally overwhelming scenes and to let myself realize that this is history. And quite recent history. As much as I wish this were another story of some fictional premise I would be in denial which is exactly what this film aims to alter. Because of these very reasons Holocaust films are usually not very successful. 'Schindler's List' remains as a preeminent exception to this. I was amazed to learn that Steven Spielberg was behind this masterpiece. Apparently among other great directors Scorsese & Polanski were also given the opportunity. And I am damn glad it was Spielberg who ended up with it. But I have to admit I would not have said this before seeing what he can do; apparently the variety of his talents. The same man who brought us the Indiana Jones & Jurassic Park series. Where is the Hollywood action? The pizazz? The overdone glamour? Even his more serious films Saving Private Ryan Catch Me If You Can Munich seem to be done by a completely different director. To me they all pale in comparison to this film which I confidently assert as the quintessential Holocaust/Nazi film. Spielberg's choice to film in black & white illustrated the foresight and vision of a master. Furthermore his selection of what minimal color would be used (bookend scenes & the young girl's red coat) was pure genius. It gives the film a timeless quality yet matching the feel and style of the time of the events rather than the time of filming. Whether or not intended the film also drew parallels to Italian Neorealism traditionally filmed on location with some unprofessional actors telling the stories of struggle and everyday life. The girl's red coat was a conspicuous way to make a visually beautiful statement. Our eyes are drawn to this unexpected sparse vivid infusion of color. ""Look at me"" it says. ""You can try to be in denial but this is really happening. You cannot pretend it isn't These deaths this injustice this wrong is not going away on its own."" And in fact it is when Schindler realizes that the girl he observed so silently only days before is now gone forever signaled only by her red coat that he sees this and begins his dramatic character shift. The second use of color in the bookends seems to be primarily for the candles. Both scenes portray a family observing The Shabbat. In the opening bookend before the start of the war we watch two votive candles melt away into nothing; in a beautiful use of cinematography the last of the smoke from the candles lightly colored dissolves and transforms into the black and white smoke from a train arriving in Krakow Poland. A title card announces World War II. In the closing bookend to signify redemption and the renewal of hope these same candles are relit; color is renewed.",16 June 2017
Amazing!,This Movie was sensational. It was a piece of art along with being informational. It told people about the holocaust and it also told people about the human spirit. It shows how people can just triumph over anything with just some help from one person The things that Spielberg did with the movie was incredible too. The black and white was genius and how he had the little girl in red and the fire was phenuminal. I have never seen anything like it Schindler's List is beyond all words.,3 May 2002
The worrying amount of 1/10s is why we still need this film and holocaust movies in general,"The first time I've seen it Schindler's list didn't give me much of an impression. It was horrific black and white and I was 15. Now after I got myself quite a cinematographic culture feeling the urge to identify Spieblerg's masterpiece I came back to this movie. I knew it was rated as one of the best films generally ever but when I took a look at the reviews I became really worried. Most of the 1/10 ratings bring reasonless motivations for this film's criticism. The main points of criticism that I saw are the following: 1) it manipulates facts; 2) presents a too distinct line between good jews and evil Nazis; 3) too emotional; 4) money grab; 5) ""Holocaust is bad we already knew it"" (and this is an almost exact quote);1) the claims for this point of criticism are that it portrays a positive figure of Oskar Schindler exaggerates several aspects of the holocaust and portrays essentially bad Nazis (we to this latter point in 2)); Let's get this straight: unlike some reviewers claim Oskar Schindler didn't end up as an enriched Industrialist as some reviewers wrongly claim. In other words he didn't earn off the holocaust anything. On the contrary he spent his entire fortune on bribes and corruption acts in order to aid his Jewish workers. He even had to escape to Argentina as many Nazi officers did after WWII. As for the claims of overly dramatisation that is certainly an aspect of the film. There are a few scenes which are not accurate (e.g. the shower scene - in real life jews didn't fear the gas chamber as they where purposely misinformed). Generally though I didn't see that much of an overly dramatization. Most of the times the film presented simply factual events. Jews were in fact killed and persecuted there's nothing overly dramatized. Concentration camps where truly such bloody places as seen in the film. Instead maybe it even downgraded violence quite a lot. still being incredibly bloody as a film.2) Good jews vs. bad Nazis; I remember Hans Landa's monologue from the beginning of Inglorious Basterds which centered on jews being rats in the sense that they're generally a population that could figure out a solution easily. Do not get me wrong here (obviously Landa stereotypes this immensely) but this is portrayed often mainly in the first portion of the film. Jews going to the Synagogue to buy and sell instead of praying some jews that join the police force and essentially collaborate with the Nazis and some jews fight each other when hiding away during the ghetto persecution scene. I clearly would not say that all jews are good nor that all German soldiers are bad but that shouldn't be a matter to be portrayed in a holocaust film. To see an avid jew go watch ""A Christmas Carol"". As for ""bad Nazis"" I'd like to clear out again what is Nazional-Socialism. It was an extremist right-wing movement that enhanced in this case Germany's national identity and superiority on the base of racial distinction and urged violence on anyone that would not be member of the ""superior"" race. This movement along with fascism attracted a great deal of fanatics. I'd like to suggest the view of ""Novecento"" which similarly depicts the rise of fascism in Italy and its ruthless cruelty carried on by it he insane and violent individuals which joined the party in the early twenties. I know that one movie depicted a Nazi soldier's moral division during WWII called ""Onore e Lealt√†"" which has low reviews for the same reason that prevents this film from portraying ""good"" Nazis: it is kind of dangerous and can easily turn in a glorification of Nazis. Nonetheless most of the cruelty is carried through a notorious war criminal Amon Goeth. 3) Spielberg is of Jewish origins. As a filmmaker he's considered this story very personal. Moreover he is notorious for being emotional in his serious films. 4) It is well known that Spielberg chose to renounce for his fee as he considered it ""blood money"". Of course studios have to do a profit of their movies but film is still a form of art. Movie makers of Spielberg's caliber do films without a simple capitalistic view of making money but with the purpose of making an art work. Schindler's list is not a fancy action blockbuster if nothing else its black and white colouring identifies it as an art film. Add the fact the Spielberg felt personal about this story and you'll realise how empty this claim is.5) This film was released in 1993; I personally don't know many outstanding holocaust films from before 1993 (certainly a lot from after 1993) or if there were they certainly weren't as bold as this one. A black and white film about a crude subject that keeps the viewer's attention for 3 hours and 15 minutes. Think about it. I personally believe that unlike other films (this includes my favourite holocaust film Son of Saul) gives a such wide view on the holocaust. This film shows most of the aspects of the holocaust some overrdramatised but nonetheless represented. It is really stupid to see this movie as unnecessary. Conclusively I'd like to point out that 6 million jews died due to the Holocaust. The only bigger genocide I know of is that of the native Americans 18 million only in northen America. Seeing so many 1/10 reviews that base their claims on this being basically Jewish propaganda is worrying especially considering the rise of right-wing ideologies that happened in the latter years. Are we forgetting history? I hope not. And in case that's the truth it's films like Schindler's list that remind us of that.",24 September 2017
the best of the Spielberg I watched,Schindler 's List is the best film about Nazism that I 've seen so far  the script is great  the cast is amazing Liam Neeson  Ralph Fiennes  Ben Kingsley and etc.  the direction is Steven Spielberg  I admit that surprised me  you do not believe that the director of Jurassic Park  Jaws and √â.T  directed this film is very different from the ones I mentioned  is only a proof that Spielberg is excellent and versatile the photography is excellent  the film is all black and white and the costumes and excellent performances are great Liam Neeson ta great  plus the highlight in my view is Ralph Fiennes who is impeccable  the soundtrack is good and the end is excellent  the film has a rhythm reasonable  I did not find it tiring  but many can become bored  Schindler 's List is so far in my opinion the best of Spielberg who has exciting moments and a great cast.

"""We Intend To Watch This Basket Very Closely.""",The Great Escape tells the amazing story of a whole bunch of allied prisoners who accomplish a mass breakout during World War II some of whom actually did make it to freedom and the allied armed forces once again. The film is so good that you do not mind the fact that some American players were tossed into the story as the real story was one accomplished by the British.To insure that the American movie public would be buying tickets several American players got into The Great Escape. Charles Bronson James Coburn and a pair of American TV cowboys just breaking into big screen star status James Garner and Steve McQueen were put in the film. Director John Sturges had worked with McQueen Coburn and Bronson in his last film The Magnificent Seven. Sturges does a grand job in never letting his audiences attention flag for one minute in this almost three hour length film.What the Nazis have done in this film is to build a brand new prison camp and have put all the perennial escape artists in this one. Of course by doing so a whole lot of talented escape artists in one place.And the organized effort is led by Richard Attenborough. Without going overboard into a whole lot of flag waving Sturges and Attenborough give us the portrayal of a deeply patriotic man who if he can't back into the fight himself is going to do what he can from a POW camp to bedevil the people making war on his country. He leads the mass escape attempt with an almost corporate efficiency.The opposite of course is Steve McQueen. I've always thought of Captain Virgil Hills as the ultimate Steve McQueen role of individualism. He and flight officer Angus Lennie are going to get out no matter what on their own or with the group. Angus Lennie is the former jockey now RAF flight officer and his death amidst a Fourth of July party that McQueen Garner and Jud Taylor have is one of the most moving scenes ever put on film. McQueen decides to play for the team after that.The Great Escape allowed McQueen to indulge in one of his hobbies of motorcycling. His race through the German country side on a stolen Nazi uniform and motorcycle is a spectacular one aided and abetted by Elmer Bernstein's magnificent film score.James Garner bonds with Donald Pleasance in the film. Garner is an American in the RAF Eagle Squadron Americans who couldn't wait for their own country to get into the war who enlisted in the RAF. A lot of Garner's TV character of Bret Maverick is in his role as Hendley the scrounger/con artist. Pleasance is his room mate the shy bird watcher who does the work of forging documents for the escaping prisoners. He's going blind as it turns out my guess would be from untreated glaucoma. It's nice to see Donald Pleasance for once as a nice guy on the screen. His death due in part to his incipient blindness is also a moving one.Charles Bronson is also another foreign volunteer for the RAF from Poland as befitting Bronson who is of Polish origin. He's the tunnel digger who suffers from claustrophobia and his scenes are primarily with British teen idol John Leyton. This was another of a long series of great character roles for Bronson on his way to stardom.James Coburn shows that like Robert Mitchum he too had a good ear for accents. His Aussie speech pattern is as good as Mitchum's was in The Sundowners.The Germans here are also portrayed three dimensionally. Robert Graf is the not too bright corporal who isn't exactly happy to be at war but is grateful he ain't serving in Russia. He gets unmercifully conned by Garner. Hannes Messemer is the commandant of the POW camp an officer in the Luftwaffe. The prisoners are nearly all RAF officers and enlisted men and the Luftwaffe is in charge of the camp. Messemer is as fearful of the S.S. and the Gestapo as his prisoners are. He's also as very conscious of the atrocities those worthy organizations are capable of and my favorite scene in the film is him having to tell of one to the Senior British officer in the camp James Donald. Messemer is conscious also of his failure to watch the basket of rotten eggs put in his charge very closely.The Great Escape does the one essential thing for a movie to do it moves. Even in just the scenes of planning and preparation you are aware of movement. I mentioned Elmer Bernstein's film score. It's one of Bernstein's best maybe one of the best known of any film in cinema history. The Great Escape is one of those films you can watch dozens of times and never tire of. It's a wonderful film a real tribute to the best in mankind under some of the worst circumstances.,17 September 2006
The Great Movie,"The Germans ""with madness in their method"" have taken every captured flier who has made repeated attempts to escape and put them in a POW camp which they have devised to be inescapable. Under the supervision of Richard Attenborough they immediately begin to dig tunnels to break out 250 men.There are anhistorical elements here. There were four tunnels dug not the three in the movie; the date of the escape was changed; most notably several American flyers took part in the breakout. While Americans did take part in the planning and construction they had been moved to a different camp by the time of the event. This was an American film and director John Sturges had been trying to get this project off the ground for the better part of a decade before he and the Mirisches got United Artists to foot the bill so James Garner Steve McQueen and Charles Bronson (as a Pole) got major roles. UA also wanted a shorter running time and some women which Sturges was able to resist.It's a great gripping blend of suspense and thrills with some pawky humor thrown in and a canny shift in camerawork. The first two-thirds with its closed-in spaces sustains an element of oppression culminating with the breakout at night in the confined space of the tunnel. This is followed by brightly lit and open vistas as the escapees make their ways towards freedom. Because Sturges had directed THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN the remake of Kurosawa's THE SEVEN SAMURAI I thought for many years this dichotomy was taken from Kurosawa's HIGH AND LOW. However the latter picture was released four months after Sturges'.170 minutes is a very long time for a feature film and this was undoubtedly released in a road show version with an intermission. The natural place for a break would be right after the Germans discover the primary tunnel. Nowadays when I watch this I can take a break whenever I like. Even knowing how it comes out it's a struggle to stop the movie at any point.",13 January 2022
Not just great simply magnificent more like!,"""Wait a minute you aren't seriously suggesting that if I get thru the wire and case everything out there and don't get picked up to turn myself in and get thrown in the cooler for a couple of months so you can get the information you need""Smart witty and directed with adroit hands by John Sturges The Great Escape is standing the test of time as a joyous multi cast family favourite. Based on the real accounts of allied soldiers escaping en mass from a German POW camp back in 1942 the film is involving from start to finish due in the main to the wonderful array of characters on show. We follow them from the moment they arrive at the camp right through to the stunning climax and it is with great joy I say that none of the cast lets the side down they all do great work for the astute and undervalued Sturges. A number of great set pieces align with Elmer Bernstein's fabulous score to never let the blood settle and in among the cheeky slices of humour is palpable tension to make this simply one of the best films of its type in fact one of the best films ever.Sturges and his writers James Clavell & W.R. Burnett adapt from the book written by Paul Brickhill someone who speaks from experience having been one of the prisoners of super POW camp Stalag Luft III which of course is what The Great Escape is born from. Sturges was fascinated by the story and after trying without fail for over a decade to get it onto the screen he finally succeeded. The success three years earlier of his star ensemble Western The Magnificent Seven enabled Sturges to realise his vision the result of which is still enthralling new generations with each passing year.The cast is made up of notable thespians and iconic heroes. Steve McQueen (enticing the American audience in one feels) Richard Attenborough Charles Bronson James Donald Donald Pleasance James Coburn James Garner David McCallum John Leyton and Gordon Jackson. Which of course is a pretty tidy roll call but the input and impact of Hannes Messemer as the Camp Commandant Colonel Von Luger should not be understated. His scenes have a real humanistic quality that shows a softer side of Germany to the one ruled by a certain despot (the finale here offering up the counter opposite of the war) the writers smartly and rightly not tarring a nation with the same old brush.A wonderful involving movie that puts characteristic heart in bed with the action and suspense laden plot. 10/10",4 March 2008
If you're going to critique the history then know the history.,"I find it difficult to believe that some reviewers' negative reactions to this film are based on their (misguided) beliefs that none of this could possibly have happened. Comments like these make it crystal clear that what some people don't know about history is appalling. If you are going to judge a film based on historical fact it helps if you know what it is. It is well-documented what amazing technical feats the POW's were able to accomplish in the stalags. There was even an entire section of the British Secret Service dedicated to coming up with all sorts of clever ways to send these captured men the tools they needed to facilitate their escape attempts i.e. sandwiching maps between the split sides of a record album (yes the Germans allowed the prisoners to have records in the camps) or compasses in pens. At Colditz Castle one of the more forbidding stalags (actually an offlag since is was for officers only) many many tunnels were dug and disguises created. One man actually created a German sergeant's uniform totally from scratch donned a moustache and created an overall impersonation so realistic it fooled two out of three sets of sentries. Some of the POW's built and concealed an entire glider that would have carried two men off the roof and over the wall! The only reason it didn't fly was because the prison was liberated before they got the chance! The Colditz experience is well documented. There are many books written about that particular prison complete with photographs including one by a German officer confirming these amazing escapes and attempts. The reviewers who doubt what can be done when necessity is truly the mother of invention should look for them and learn something. As for the prisoners not being in jumpsuits as suggested by one reviewer as one reason to question the authenticity of the film? Ludicrous POW's wore what they were captured in. The German military (different from the Gestapo and the SS) considered them soldiers and allowed them to keep their badges of rank.As for the film itself it is long but absorbing. There are historical flaws (as there are in all movies) but several of the former POW's participated in the filming process keeping it for the most part very authentic. As for the emphasis on Americans it's true they were not among the escapees per se but several did assist in the effort before they were transferred out as mentioned by a previous reviewer. However you must remember that the movie was made for an American audience in 1963 long before international distribution revenue became so important to a studio's bottom line. They needed American stars who would appeal to an American audience. Who knows perhaps if they were to remake it today the cast would be all British and German but I doubt it (see ""Hart's War"" where not only the plot but all the British and Canadian characters that were in the book disappeared).All in all ""The Great Escape"" is an entertaining movie telling a fascinating story of what ordinary men can achieve in adverse circumstances. It's well worth the time.",31 January 2003
A vast multi-star war epic with great score by Elmer Bernstein...,"'The Great Escape' had the advantage of a fine source and a fine script... Each actor realizes his potential in a very detailed manner giving a feeling lost in the actual cinema...Sturges is careful with the pace in the first half allowing the escape plans develop slowly... Humor excitement and human drama are wonderfully blended and smartly underscored by Elmer Bernstein's memorable background music... The film opens with several truckloads of Allied officers mostly pilots being transferred to a new German maximum-security prison camp at Sagan... The Camp 'Kommandant' Von Luger (Hannes Messemer) tells Captain Ramsey (James Donald) 'We have in effect put all our rotten eggs in one basket and we intend to watch this basket carefully.'But since all the British and American officers in his charge are men who have made several attempts to escape from other prison camps Von Luger knows his words are meaningless... The master planner is 'Big X' Roger Bartlett (Richard Attenborough) who has just endured three months of Gestapo/SS torture and plans to strike back getting as many men as possible out of the camp in order to 'harass confuse and confound the enemy' behind the lines...He announces a terrific plan for a mass break-out of 250 men and schemes three simultaneous tunnels Tom Dick and Harry... The plan so precise proceeds in an orderly fashion with a great deal of attention placed on caution and ruse to deflect German attentions... The captives involve themselves in much surface activity which masks the underground work... Hilts (Steve McQuenn) the 'Cooler King' leads the Germans on a memorable motorcycle chase through back roads and across the fields right up to the Swiss frontier...Hendley (James Garner) the 'Scrounger' is a charming thief whose particular gift is the misappropriation of all the required supplies for an escape...Blythe (Donald Pleasance) has the talents of a 'Forger' and makes visas and passports... He suggests in one scene: ' Tea without milk is so uncivilized.'Danny Velinski (Charles Bronson) is the experienced Polish-American 'Tunnel-King.' Louis Sedgwick (James Coburn) is the 'Manufacturer' of bellows-operated ventilation...Ashley-Pitt (David McCallum) is the 'Dispersal' with his ingenious methods of getting rid of the dirt generated by the tunneling activities... Andy McDonald (Gordon Jackson ) is 'Intelligence' the officer who develops a fantastic security system to protect the compounds from the German ""Ferrets."" Archibald Ives (Angus Lennie) is the 'Mole' whose fragile mind has been taxed by several years in the camps repeated failed escape attempts and time in the cooler...Dennis Cavendish (Nigel Stock) is the 'Surveyor' who miscalculates the distance to the trees...Guard Werner (Robert Graf) is the 'Ferret' who affirms to Hendley: 'I could tell you stories about my teeth that would make your hair stand on end.' 'The Great Escape' is a pretty good motion picture where the toll of freedom is precious and the movie's ending provokes deep and serious meditation... It graphically shows what enterprising men can accomplish under the most unusual circumstances... It has a great cast and is beautifully made...",18 July 2001
Excellent...but the history teacher in me could have hoped for just a bit more...,"I am a tough audience for historical films. As a retired history teacher I often notice when details are wrong--and I am not the sort of person you'd like to go to such a movie with as I will invariably complain about the historical license the filmmakers took in regard to the facts. Now I sometimes realize that there are times when changing the facts a bit might not be such a bad thing--but too often the writers just don't seem to care if they get it right. Because of this I generally love ""The Great Escape"" as it IS based on a real mass escape and the characters are often based on these actual men. BUT what I struggle with is the studio's insistence that Americans be included in the cast--though in the actual escape this was NOT the case. What makes it worse is that two of these Americans (Steve McQueen and James Garner) were among the leads in the film--making the event seem like it was planned and executed thanks to the good 'ol USA. Now I love my country but I love the truth even more and it made me feel bad that the Brits and their Commonwealth members somehow got the short end of this. But on the other hand the film does do a very job otherwise when it comes to portraying this period in history.I could review the film at length but there are countless other reviews on this movie already. The bottom line is that the film has exceptional acting really fine dialog and is well made throughout--and is clearly one of the best war films can find. Well worth seeing and a film that easily justifies its nearly three hour running time.",27 December 2011
Behind the Wire,"Exactly fifty years ago this month I first saw this on BBC1 with the never to be repeated news that it was ""the first ever screening on British television"".The fact that it's deservedly become a classic obscures the fact that (SPOILER COMING:) director John Sturges was adamant about retaining the ending of John Brickhill's 1956 bestseller which for several years made it an impossible pitch until he enjoyed a huge hit with 'The Magnificent Seven' and was finally able to interest the money men by reuniting three of The Seven.To keep costs down it was shot in Europe and the authentic German locations - and the largely British supporting cast - simply made the result even more distinctive.",31 December 2021
Awesome warlike movie with memorable images and outstanding acting by well-known faces,This is a splendid film about a daring breakout from inescapable Nazi concentration camp  Stalag Luft North  with all star cast and magnificently realized by John Sturges . It's partially based on facts adapted by James Clavell and W.R. Burnett from a bestselling written by Paul Brickhill .

It deals with hard preparatives of a diverse group formed by rebel air officers and soldiers mounting a dangerous getaway from a barbed-wired and strongly controlled camp . The most part of the film concerns on the elaborated process of secretly digging an underground tunnel and the last one deals with spectacular breakout and effort the approx. 70 escaped prisoners throughout Germany trying to make their bid to freedom  including an impressive motorcycle pursuit in charge of iconic Steve McQueen for one of the best action sequences in years .This exciting story contains thrills intrigue tension excitement galore entertainment and lots of fun . Suspenseful WWII epic packs exceptional plethora of prestigious actors incarnating the motley group of POWs  giving good acting and support  as a sensational Steve McQueen whose character  ¨The Cooler King¨  remains today as attractive iconography ; Charles Bronson as digging expert but suffering claustrophobia ; Donald Pleasance as professional on forge documents but blind  James Coburn as roguish Australian and of course Richard Attenborough as Air Force Squadron leader who plans the massive breakout  furthermore  James Garner as American officer  the British Gordon Jackson and David McCallum among others .

Sit back and enjoy a few cold ones while you watch this classic WWII movie. Easily one of the best war movies ever made...,15 December 2019
We Choose the Cooler,Spoilers herein.Films are like people in the respect that some are leaders but most followers. That's because most movies are not about life but about previous movies. This film established not only a genre (I chose to resee it after `Chicken Run') but played a role in inventing a society. I'm of the belief that culture invents some art that in turn reinvents the culture. More about that in a minute.What's so special about this is that it places the American rebel (with his motorcycle) in mainstream American society. Before the beatnik or `bohemian' was unamerican nonmainstream. This film invents memories of the war for the generation after the war -- it takes an essentially British story and uses it as background to establish a new vision of the American rebel. This rebel is centrally American heroic even. Independent of sex.There are four forces in this film. The evil Gestapo (with the majority of Germans but the film glosses that); the two forces of the British and German Air Force stuck in a duel of gallantry from a prior generation; and then the McQueen force. All at once we have the cockiness and independence of Brando and Dean transformed into a patriotic center into something directed seemingly casually against intrinsic evil.I saw an advance screening of this in most peculiar circumstances. I was a cadet in a midwestern military academy whose commandant was the senior American officer at the POW camp during the planning of the escape. (Americans were moved shortly before and the reason is an interesting story in itself.) We 850 mostly sons of republicans mostly hawks all white were given a vision of necessary disturbance of a strange patriot that we couldn't internalize. Only a couple months later JFK was murdered. The Cooler King was one key image we used with our brethren nationwide to reinvent ourselves. Check it out. This contributed to a national identity that actually lived for a while. Never plan to win just make your own statement.Attenborough knows something about manipulating the British image for American consumption. His `Ghandi' is a masterpiece of posture. Talent. Sturges' camera is quiet still non-modern so that you lose awareness that this is a film. This stance is dated -- wouldn't work today and makes things feel as of a different era. Attenborough's camera sweeps (see his short episode -- the Indian sequence -- in `Close Encounters.') Attenborough's acting style here (indeed his role too) mirrors that. It is a fulcrum of everything a subliminal sweep under Sturges' stillness.Check out the score by Bernstein. If you take out just a little of the march tempo you have Williams' copy for Indiana Jones. Indy echoed the tone for a by that time narcissistic notion of rebellion: mystical forces of evil accommodated by selfish acquisition and pathetic self-deprecation -- the Reagan American. Williams intended to quote Bernstein to make this point I think.If you haven't seen it yet look for the Cooler guard. His hesitation at the end is priceless indicating that every soul is malleable. It is why the film wasn't made for eight years bombed when it came out but is now in the IMDB top 100.,23 February 2001
Still fantastic stuff almost 60 years later,Such a classic. It's been over 10 years since I first watched this and returning to it tonight I think I liked it even more.You could argue this is THE prison escape movie. Even if it's not the best prison movie ever the fact that it's almost 100% about setting up and executing the escape for almost three hours means it's hard to imagine something with a similar premise being much better.It's well-paced for its length and it's a good sign that all the set-up is just as good as the pay-offs in the second half. You could argue the last hour drags a little but it also contains many of the film's most memorable scenes (yes I know the movie's nearly 60 years old but I'm still going to be vague in case anyone who reads this hasn't seen it 😅)Goes without saying but Steve McQueen is incredibly cool but it's a testament to how great the rest of the cast is that McQueen's character can spend so much time in solitary confinement and the movie still moves well and entertains without him.Closest thing to a flaw if I had to pick one? Prison looks almost a little too fun here because of how likeable the characters are. They're all cool and funny and in a way that makes this prison camp look less hellish than it could be. I definitely understand why they want to escape but it doesn't capture the horrors of prison life as much as other prison movies.That being said there are a few heavy scenes in the movie that do serve as reminders of how terrible the war was as a whole and how ruthless the German army could be. So the atmosphere being relaxed at times in the first half is a pretty minor complaint.So: great acting great pacing great music exciting scenes and plenty of suspense... it all adds up to a great time and it's aged brilliantly for a movie of its age. It stands as both an essential WW2 film and an essential prison movie.,23 April 2022
A genuine timeless classic.,During World War Two the Germans build a new prison camp Stalag Luft III for the express purpose of housing many of their most troublesome captured Allied airmen. However all this serves to do is to pool the resources of some of the most ingenious escape artists in captivity and fill them with a resolve to engineer a mass breakout from the camp.  Based largely on real events this film has assumed classic status over the years and its easy to understand why. Quite simply it excells in many departments. Director John Sturges was at the height of his creative powers and he keeps a firm grip on the proceedings. Although the film runs close to three hours it never feels sluggish while at the same time winding up the tension gradually and developing the characters. The production design is first rate to the point where Donald Pleasance (who had been a P.O.W.) felt quite intimidated by the vast set on his arrival. Daniel Fapp's beautiful photography shows this and the picturesque German locations off to full effect. Put these virtues together with a good script inspired casting and a classic score by Elmer Bernstein and you have an object lesson in how to create an intelligent and exciting big budget adventure film.  On the subject of the cast; Much is made of Steve McQueen's role. While I am a huge McQueen fan I feel that some of the other performances are equal to if not better than his. Richard Attenborough James Garner Donald Pleasance Charles Bronson and Gordon Jackson are all excellent. Good too are James Coburn James Donald David McCallum and Hannes Messemer as the sympathetic Commandant.  This is one of those films that I can happily watch time and time again. In September of this year a new print was screened at the NFT in London as part of an 'Attenborough at 80' season. It was a pleasure to see this on the big screen at last. For the most part the print was in very good condition. The DVD was one of the first that I ever bought some three and a half years ago and I watched its inevitable Christmas screening on BBC2 last night. I just never tire of it. In these days of brainless poorly executed action fodder its a joy to behold something that hits its targets so precisely.,28 December 2003
I simply love this golden classic.,I first saw this in the late 80s on a vhs then again in the mid 90s on a vhs n then again in the early 2k on a dvd which I own.(Added this bracketed stuff in Dec 2021 aft watching this movie again in Dec 2021 but this time with my teenaged kids. This is their first McQueen movie n now they kno why their dad is a big fan of McQueen. They too enjoyed this movie).The acting and character development is outstanding.The direction is top notch.Each character is extremely well-developed.The director takes extra care to make sure we understand each of their roles and motivation.This movie is studded with amazing star cast - James Coburn Charles Bronson Steve McQueen James Garner James Donald Donald Pleasence Richard Attenborough David McCallum John Leyton Gordon Jackson.... and the list goes on.Almost 3 hours long n you can barely find a dull moment which is fantastic.The movie is fast paced n very captivating.The musical score the cinematography n editing are all top notch.John Sturges' direction is excellent.The escape is filled with suspense and the last hour of the movie we see our prisoners on the run by plane train bicycle boat on foot etc and in McQueen's case by motorcycle.By this time we are rooting for each n every character as they all try to make it out of Nazi Germany.This movie Bullit Hell is for Heroes Papillon n The Getaway made me a huge Steve McQueen fan. Indeed he was the coolest one.,31 March 2016
The greatest of escapes.,The Great Escape is THE prison escape movie. The film is rich with characters and the direction by John Sturges is great. Steve McQueen is the man and the rest of the cast are terrific. This movie is heroic and shows the bravery of men in the second world war. I escape into this movie whenever I feel really down it's a great spirit lifter and one of the greatest films of all time.,15 December 1998
Great Movie,This film does take a few libertys with facts there were no Americans involved in the escape though some helped plan it and where transferred to another camp at the last moment.This film though is about heroes and the spirit of freedom.T he film belongs to McQueen who is just fantastic to watch the camera loved him and I believe one day he will jump that fence.The rest of the cast are particurlarly good the scene where the forger is told he can't escape is moving especially when James Garner volunteers to look after him.The James Garner character is roll model for me I always try to scrounge things.Simply watch and enjoy a truly great movie you will laugh and then feel down. I give this movie 8/10,30 December 2003
Heroes underground.,"I imagine it was the lengthy running time that kept me for so many years from seeing The Great Escape although that doesn't explain why I haven't seen hordes of other movies. But I've been going back and watching all the old classics and The Great Escape is one of the best ones I've seen so far. The movie is not only wildly entertaining throughout it's nearly three hour duration but shows some actors who went on to become famous for other roles in decades and generations to come. Granted I am speaking from the perspective of a different generation of moviegoers which is why I know Charles Bronson more from Death Wish than this film or James Coburn from films like Payback and Affliction Donald Pleasance as Dr. Sam Loomis and Richard Attenborough as John Hammond from the Jurassic Park films.I think the thing I loved the most about the movie was how open everyone was about their plans to escape. Not that they tried to escape out in the open but they made no effort to hide the fact that they were analyzing their surroundings trying to find a way to get out. As we soon learn it is their sworn duty as captured officers to consistently try to escape and failing that to make life as confusing and frustrating as humanly possible for their captors. The story involves a lot of British officers being held captive by the Germans at a prison where all of the most consistent escapers have been compiled for special supervision. When the prisoners arrive at the beginning of the movie many of them including Virgil Hilts (Steve McQueen) walk into the gates and then immediately walk to the fences around the outsides of the compound looking up and down the length of the fences studying where the guard towers are looking in broad daylight for ways to escape.What follows is a brilliant competition between the proud British officers being held captive and the Germans guarding them as the British make every attempt to escape and receive minimal punishment when they're caught. 20 days in the cooler for a failed escape attempt (doubled from only 10 for mouthing off) is pretty light compared to what I would have expected POWs to have suffered at the hands of the Nazis in World War II.Because the escapes are only hidden during their preparations there are portions of The Great Escape that play almost like a sports movie more than a war film because of the atmosphere of competition and among other things there is so much comic relief One of my favorite scenes is the one where they first begin digging under the floor in their bunker. Danny Velinski (Bronson) is under the floor digging away when the Germans march in for a surprise inspection and he jumps out they put the cover back on the hole and smear clay around it and then pour water into it one guy starts mopping the floor everyone else goes back to playing cards or milling about and Velinski hops in the shower and the suspicious officers come in and demand to know what they're each doing. The guy mopping explains that he's mopping Velinski says he needed a wash and Louis Sedgwick (Coburn) says about Velinski ""I'm watching him. I'm a lifeguard!""It's also a great scene when Hilts (McQueen) tells Bartlett (Attenborough) and the other officer his plan for escape. Steve McQueen is the star of the movie but spends most of it pretty much out of the loop. He was in the cooler when the plans for the great escape were first hatched so when he finally got out most of the camp was involved in planning this epic breakout and Hilts comes up to Bartlett and one other officer and gleefully tells them about his and Ives' nutty plan to burrow three feet down and dig straight out sticking metal tubes through the ground to the surface so they can breathe. Bartlett and the other officer leave both of them out of the plans for the time being for reasons that are explained later in the film.The movie is expertly written with outstanding dialogue and even better performances and direction that I like to think is still inspiring filmmakers throughout the world. I learned from another reviewer on the IMDb that the music is almost competing within itself with different instruments representing the British and the Germans so I was watching for it when I watched the movie. Not only is the different music representative of the two opposing sides but it does it within scenes and even within individual shots. Consider for example the scene where Hilts and Ives are first brought into the cooler. The music is almost reacting to what is going on on screen like it's trying to describe where each character is within the frame. That is true film-making brilliance. The movie ends with a massive setback a tremendous downturn in tone but does so without turning into a tragedy or overshadowing everything else that has gone on before that and most importantly while remaining true to the real life story. It displays the pride and determination of British military as well as was done in The Bridge on the River Kwai and that is a major accomplishment. Bravo.",24 April 2005
Quick Reviews!!,POSSIBLE SPOILERS!!Exciting funny tragic with a massive cast who all perform brilliantly providing many memorable moments The Great Escape as everyone knows tells the story of the attempted escape of allied troops from German imprisonment. The characters are all well drawn both Allies and Nazis and each has a distinct personality though McQueen's stands out. Even though only a few escape this is still a story of hope to rival The Shawshank Redemption. Memorable scenes are obvious: Steve's biking Pleasance's tragic end the celebrations which end in death the 'get out and stretch your legs' scene and the train station scene. With beautiful cinematography and a rousing score this is a favourite for many people-it's shown here every Christmas. Interesting in that this is one of the few films i can think of which has no female character of note. 9 out of 10,16 November 2004
GREAT MOVIE: MORE HISTORICALLY ACCURATE THAN SOME REALIZE...,"This is a great movie which much more historically accurate than it is often given credit for. So many who say otherwise are ill-informed and obviously don't know much about the actual history of that actual escape. The depiction of what happened to the recaptured prisoners in the movie of THE GREAT ESCAPE is reasonably accurate as detailed on the historyinfilm site...specifically on the ""Reprisal"" page; along with being detailed in the various published accounts.Hitler ultimately calmed down after being reasoned with by Goering Feldmarschall Keitel Maj-Gen Graevenitz and Maj-Gen Westhoff and dictated that more than half the prisoners be shot and cremated. So as depicted in the film several of those recaptured were not executed and were indeed returned to confinement. In fact even those executed were not ""shot on the spot"" for the most part but were actually executed later after being turned over to the Gestapo; most being shot while being allowed to relieve themselves under the guise of ""trying to escape"".Furthermore there are many accounts as to how much more humane the environment was within the camp (which even had a popular and very successful theatre featuring prisoners who would later be name performers) than many other POW camps...and certainly nothing like the harsh conditions associated with the Concentration or Extermination camps.To quote one source:""It must be made clear that the German Luftwaffe [the German Air Force] who were responsible for Air Force prisoners of war maintained a degree of professional respect for fellow flyers and the general attitude of the camp security officers and guards should not be confused with the SS or Gestapo. The Luftwaffe treated the POWs well despite an erratic and inconsistent supply of food.Prisoners were handled quite fairly within the Geneva Convention and the Kommandant Oberst (Colonel) Friedrich-Wilhelm von Lindeiner-Wildau was a professional and honourable soldier who won the respect of the senior prisoners.""Finally virtually all the major engineering aspects in regards to the tunnels and the initial escape in the film are as they were actually acheived in the real escape.It would behoove some to learn a little more actual history or do a little simple research before shooting from the hip with supposed ""knowledge"" of reality. THE GREAT ESCAPE certainly takes liberties in tone and character portrayal but not in the key elements that are disparaged out of sneering ignorance.BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI is also a great film but took even greater liberties with the technical details of the events described than THE GREAT ESCAPE did....and offering up VON RYAN'S EXPRESS as a more realistic alternative is simply delusional and ridiculous.",11 January 2004
One of the all time great war movies,I cannot dislike The Great Escape with its great cast anthem-like music score and of course its attention to detail. The film is brilliantly shot with beautiful cinematography and of course the music score is great very iconic. It may be a little annoying to some people as the theme is repeated over and over again but there is something triumphant about it so I find it hard not to like it. The script is great but it is the cast and the attention to detail that sticks in the mind. This escape yarn has everything from collapsing tunnels probing searchlights to the classic movie image of Hilts attempting to escape to freedom on a motorbike. And then there are the characters for example we have Donald Pleasence's timid forger James Garner's smooth-talking scrounger and most obviously Steve McQueen's super cool Captain Virgil Hilts. Garner Pleasence James Coburn Richard Attenborough and Charles Bronson fit their parts perfectly but for me it is McQueen's movie. Overall The Great Escape is quite simply great one of the all time great war movies. 10/10 Bethany Cox,19 April 2010
All Time Favorite,"Based on a true story ""The Great Escape"" is one of the greatest movies ever filmed. Directed by the genius John Sturges and starring Steve McQueen James Garner and one the most talented ensemble casts ever assembled the film does not have any weak parts. From the almost authentic reproduction of an actual NAZIS prison camp set to the great score from Elmer Bernstein and excellent performances by the cast this movie gets 100 out of 100 stars hands down.The World War II action/adventure story deals with POW's who devise an elaborate escape from a German Prisoner of War camp. ""The Great Escape"" will demand your complete attention from start to finish and you will find yourself watching it over and over again!!Steve McQueen James Garner Charles Bronson James Coburn Richard Attenborough Donald Pleasance and many many more stars enough words cannot be said?? How the OSCARS voters snubbed this movie in 1963 with only 1 nomination for editing is a complete travesty to this day.",12 January 2020
What a movie! 10/10,The Great Escape should be a movie every one has seen. It's the definitive P.O.W. movie -- and all other films in the genre fail to compare. It should be noted that this isn't just a Steve McQueen movie (although he is bound to be everyone's favorite character) but this is an ensemble piece with great performances by Richard Attenborough James Garner James Coburn Donald Pleasence and Charles Bronson. Wonderful build-up great middle and a terrific ending. This film is classic. One of the best scores of all time.,16 March 2002
Extremely well paced directed movie,"Greetings from Lithuania.""The Great Escape"" (1963) is a classic movie. It was extremely well made for its time and it still holds up pretty well as a WW2 prison escape adventure movie. The cast of this movie is one to behold - all star non the less. Directing by John Sturges was superb - at running time almost 3 hours this movie was excellently paced there is barely a boring or stretched moment. Editing was excellent as well good cinematography. This movie was short on characterization - its all about technical details of the escape was made and it works.Overall almost 60 years after its release this movie still holds up because of a superb pacing and directing. Also this is a movie were a lot of great and famous / legendary actors were brought in together - with most of them getting fame after this movie or later in their carriers - this film works like a great time capsule as well when seeing it in 2022.",6 February 2022
Great EscapeGreat movie,"This must be my favorite movie of all times. Having seen it for the first timein I guess 1987a BBC Christmas broadcastI was captivated by this brilliant piece of work. In the years afterI probably have seen it a ""million"" timesowning it on VHS and DVDand still watchingwhenever it is broadcastin the original language. Why is it so great? This is a movie that keeps you locked to the screenbecause it has everything a great movie should have. A great storya good lengthtensionit is a WW2 movie and the actors give top performances.Not just Steve McQueenalthough his performance is brilliantbut also James GarnerJames CoburnRichard AttenboroughCharles Bronson and in this filmone of the greatest roles Donald Pleasanceplaying the forger. It isn't historically accurateplease read the book by Paul Brickhillbut that doesn't matter a bit. This film gives you an image of POW campthe prisoners and their guardsthe Germans are also played brilliantly by German actors. I will not repeat the story herebut I can tell youthis film will capture youall the characters are portrayed brilliantly by the actors. There is excitementhumortensiondrama and emotion. See ityou will not regret it.",25 December 2005
"One Of The Best ""Caper"" Films Of All-Time!","Film-making in the 1960s was a different exercise than it is today. It was more about ""putting on a good show"" and appealing to a wide audience instead of focusing on certain key groups. Back then families went to movies together as ""outings"" and the movies were required to play as such. Sometimes this leads to strange casting and watered-down plots. Other times you get a movie like ""The Great Escape"" which combines perfect characters music and an intriguing plot to produce a masterpiece of its time.For a basic plot summary ""The Great Escape"" is set at a Nazi prisoner-of-war camp where all the ""break-out artists"" are holed up together. Eluding the eyes and ears of the guards the inmates start to work on getting out. Bartlett (Richard Attenborough) is the ring-leader while other key roles are played by Steve McQueen James Garner Donald Pleasance Charles Bronson James Coburn and James Donald. To say anything more about the plot would be to give away too many key details.This movie is such a classic because it does so many things right including:-Some of the best acting performances ever assembled in a single picture. Not a single scene is wasted due to all the on-screen talent. -Despite the tense setting a sense of humor shines through (mainly coming from McQueen's character). -A plot that will have you on the edge of your seat. You can instantly identify with the characters so you find yourself rooting for them as the escape plan builds and builds. -Not being predictable. You will think you know how this movie is going to end but it throws you enough curveballs to always keep you off-balance.For a nearly three hour movie ""The Great Escape"" never seems to lag or get boring whatsoever. It also features a score that contains a tune you will be whistling for days afterward. Basically it is the type of movie where everything (cast music plot direction) comes together for a perfect storm of film-making. If you are sometimes wary of WWII capers or older movies in general do not let that stop you from watching this one. It is one of the best.",4 March 2017
Outstanding Entertainment,Credit should be given to the brilliant score by Elmer Bernstein. If you listen to it closely it literally is a battle between the Allied Prisoners (flutes & woodwinds) and the Germans (tubas). The escape scenes with the little boat on the scenic german river is evocative of Wagner and his heroic Germanic Operas. The scenery of the German countryside and the Alps is breathtaking. I believe that the scriptwriters emphasized the heroism humor and character of the prisoners to make an uplifting statement of what is essentially a cruel and tragic story. As a child growing up in the seventies our 7th grade glass was reading the Paul Brickhill book and we had the opportunity to meet a former (American) Stalag Luft III prisoner from that era. He had arrived at the camp after the Great Escape but was placed on the monument detail for the 50 executed men. He said that few men seriously contemplated escape after this incident and the emphasis was on surviving the war and going home alive.,11 February 2004

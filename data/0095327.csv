A powerful film that shows the true cost of war,"""Grave of the Fireflies"" is one of the most ambitious depressing and quite frankly best films that I've ever seen. I was nearly moved to tears by this film's brave treatment of such critical subject matter. Yes it's an Anime' piece but surprisingly it came out in 1988 during a time where most Japanese animation films were either relentless bloodbaths borderline pornography or both.As a fan of the Anime' genre of film-making many great pieces have achieved some sort of cult status here in America yet none have really reached mainstream success. Some have broken through the barrier and have gained acceptance with American critics like Katsuhiro Otomo's ""Akira"" or ""Princess Mononoke"" or ""Spirited Away"" (both films directed by Hayao Miyazaki). One that I've seen and has been barely mentioned by most critics is ""Grave of the Fireflies.""What we have with ""Grave of the Fireflies"" is a story of innocence lost and two children who ultimately face a losing battle with trying to survive in a small Japanese village in the closing days of World War II. WWII was the costliest conflict in world history with millions dead and thousands left to pick up the pieces.In the center of it are the aforementioned two children who are pretty much left to fend for themselves after their mother is killed in a bombing raid. Because their father is off fighting in the war and they have no way of contacting any other family they're sent to live with their aunt who is at first warm and welcoming to them but eventually becomes very cruel and the children are forced to live in a nearby bomb shelter. From that point on the two children embark on a journey that is every bit as unpleasant and difficult as the grim realities of the world around them.Very easily one of the best Anime' films that I've ever seen (or any animated film for that matter) I find it difficult to believe just how truly overlooked ""Grave of the Fireflies"" is. The animation is beautiful though certainly not dated by any means (even though Japanese animation has progressed well since this film was made).We get a sense of the dread of the two lead characters who watch as the world around them crumbles into heaps of ashes and aircraft loom ominously overhead dropping their deadly incendiary cargo on unsuspecting Japanese villagers.The director Isao Takahata obviously has a special resentment of the war but manages to avoid condemning it outright. The director instead lets us focus in on the conflict as seen through the eyes of the two children who watch unflinchingly as the realities of their world begin to falter before them.""Grave of the Fireflies"" is a bold statement on the condition of the human soul during conflict. I probably shouldn't say this but I am anyways but this film has to be the ""Schindler's List"" of animated pieces. It's brave it's not overly sentimental but it is relentless in its dramatization of a dangerous reality. It should be required viewing in any high school world history class.A beautiful film; not to be missed by anyone.",28 August 2004
A masterpiece whose beauty is often overlooked,"When I watched this movie I steeled myself for a traumatic experience based on every review I'd ever read of it which usually include phrases like ""don't watch this if you're suicidal."" Instead if I had to pick a single word to sum up the movie I saw it would probably be 'beautiful'.Certainly it was sad and arguably depressing but I've read this movie compared with 'Saving Private Ryan'. That's ridiculous. 'Grave of the Fireflies' is gentle and poetic more often than it's violent and it's remarkably restrained in its anti-war message. It simply tells a story : there's very little at all in the way of moralizing or polemics. Why would a story like this need such heavy-handed tactics?I've also read it argued that the movie is robbed of any suspense or impact when it's revealed in the opening scene that the main characters are dead. I have a quite different view of that device.Firstly. the beginning of 'Fireflies' is for all intents and purposes a 'happy ending'. This is such a non-linear plot development that you could fail to notice it and thereby only see the movie's gloom. The moment where the ghostly Seita takes the ghostly Setsuko's hand and nods to her is not only a happy moment it signifies that the suffering - which is yet to come as far as the viewer is concerned - is over and they are together again (albeit still without parents).As for a character revealing that he is dead in the first line of the movie this is a device which has been used in centuries if not Milena. The crucial thing here is that 'Fireflies' isn't _about_ tension. It tells a story whose ultimate conclusion you already know (a legitimate narrative approach) and everything which happens during that story is emotionally infused with a foreknowledge of its ending. You find yourself hoping that things will go right now for Setsuko and Seita and then the knowledge that ultimately it won't undercuts you with real emotional power. You know the characters are going to die but you hope things won't be so bad in the meantime. It doesn't take much of an effort to make that an analogy for our own lives which makes us all fireflies.Perhaps what might make someone feel disappointed or cheated by this film is simply that it's so damn honest. I mean that: it's one of the most honest artifice-free movies I've ever seen. It doesn't even really try to ram an anti-war message down your throat there is very little overt violence and if there are some scenes of corpses and suffering it's never gratuitous and it's over quickly. Compare this with 'Private Ryan' where you have to suffer through 40 minutes of the most horrific blood and guts only to reach a conclusion which after much blood and thunder signifies very little.'Fireflies' OTOH has far more beauty than gore. This is what really surprised me about it. Probably two thirds of the movie takes place in gorgeously drawn tranquil rural or urban settings with an almost pleasant dreamlike quality - even when the American bombers are flying overhead at one point there is a surreal almost serene sense to it - and there are plenty of moments of happiness to offset the undeniably sadness and frustration of other scenes.Perhaps best of all Setsuko is one of the very very few (if not the only) animated 4 year-old I've ever seen who actually _behaves_ like a four year old. I'm so sick of seeing preternaturally smart sassy sophisticated and precocious children in Hollywood movies. Setsuko's emotion and behaviors are _exactly_ right for a completely normal four year-old and recognizing this lends many scenes incredible poignancy. Similarly Seita is a teenage boy who behaves with the sort of mixture of pride compassion and hubris which you'd expect of someone his age. He still believes that Japan will win the war he thinks it's up to him to take care of his sister with their mother gone and father who knows where. This leads him to make mistakes: possibly the most obvious one being where he fails to take the farmer's advice swallow his pride and ask his nasty aunt to take them back in again. You would probably have to say his decision not to even try - to go it alone instead was a very bad one but - hello people - here is a character who makes mistakes because he's actually human: a believable teenage boy in an extraordinary situation who doesn't miraculously save the day because his best judgment just isn't good enough.Of course his aunt may well have knocked them back anyway. Who knows?Don't go into the film expecting tension drama or even a tirade against war. It's a movie about the beauty and fragility of life and youth. If you think Japanese animation is all giant robots and superhuman schoolgirls this could be the film which changes your mind. It's slow poetic beautiful and sad and extraordinarily honest.I must be the only person who didn't cry during this film (and I mean I get choked up during some Disney movies). Yes it is sad but its beauty and honesty is what I'll remember.NB: this review refers to the subtitled version of the film.",4 September 2004
Powerful and Heartbreaking,"""September 21 1945...That was the night I died.""-- SeitaReading war statistics and even seeing bloody images on television does not fully communicate the horror of war as well as the heartbreaking Grave of the Fireflies an anime feature directed by Isao Takahata a long-time colleague of Hayao Miyazaki. The film tells the story of two children Seita a 14-year old boy and Setsuko his 4-year old sister and their uphill struggle to survive the effects of American firebombing in Kobe near the end of World War II. Based on the semi-autobiographical novel of Akiyuki Nosaka Grave is a powerful experience that powerfully communicates the strength of the human spirit to carry on against overwhelming odds. Though despairing the film does not resort to cheap melodrama to achieve its effect but delineates simple and direct images that are not watered-down to appeal to the children's market. It would indeed be too sad for most children under 13. In an interview with Cedric Littardi AnimeLand magazine from 1992 Takahata said that he did not set out to depress the audience but to show a natural death as opposed to a ""scientific"" death the way most of us view it -- behind closed curtains in a sanitized hospital. Takahata in some ways softens the impact of the tragedy at the outset by showing Seita dying outside a subway station and his spirit reunited with his little sister Setsuko. The story is told by flashback as the two children are left alone to fend for themselves when their mother is killed in the bombing campaign. When their father is also killed in the Navy they must struggle against starvation the cruelty of an aunt they trusted people's general indifference and their own pride. Though both children eventually succumb to malnutrition (or radiation poisoning) the animation is so lyrical that it creates a magical dream-like effect. This does not mask the tragedy but makes it all the more poignant. Nothing sums up the message of this film better than the beautiful poem ""I Come and Stand at Every Door"" by Nazim Hikmat one of the most important and influential figures in 20th-century Turkish literature. I come and stand at every door. But no one hears my silent tread. I knock and yet remain unseen. For I am dead for I am dead.I'm only seven although I died. In Hiroshima long ago. I'm seven now as I was then. When children die they do not grow.My hair was scorched by swirling flame. My eyes grew dim my eyes grew blind. Death came and turned my bones to dust. And that was scattered by the wind.I need no fruit I need no rice. I need no sweet nor even bread. I ask for nothing for myself. For I am dead for I am dead.All that I ask is that for peace. You fight today you fight today. So that the children of this world. May live and grow and laugh and play.	-- Nazim HikmetIn our day where our leaders are busily preparing for another war it is important to remember the human cost of these plans and the untold suffering they will inevitably bring. Grave of the Fireflies should be required viewing in the Oval office.",11 November 2002
A Beautiful Unforgettable Masterpiece that shows the true cost of war.,"I decided to watch Grave of the Fireflies yesterday. My friends told me it was extremely moving and sad. I hesitated at first but then I said ""Oh well I'll give it a try."" At the end of the film I was crying my eyes out. This was the best animated film I've ever seen.This is a moving depiction of the fates of cast-off children who become casualties of war.This movie isn't your regular Animated Film. Pixar and Disney put films out there with happy endings. I'm not saying there bad films at all. They are also great pieces of work. But Grave of the Fireflies tells you the truth. This movie isn't trying to entertain you. It wants to inform you about how war is really like. There were many moments in the movie that just brought me to tears.I am kind of upset that this movie didn't get many awards as it should. In that regards it is VERY underrated and it is kind of thrown apart. When it should really be respected and praise it. If this movie was made in our time period right now. I would be 100% sure this would of Won an Oscar for Best Animated Film. This is Studio Ghilbi's best movie they have ever released.I truly advice you to bring a handkerchief cause chances are that you will cry.An Emotional Epic Animated Film that I recommend everyone to watch.Quite Simply 10/10",16 June 2010
Beautiful haunting and emotionally devastating,"What an amazing film! Very rarely have I been moved this much by an animated film. Watership Down yes Bambi yes Secret of NIMH yes Beauty and the Beast yes Land Before Time yes but Grave of the Fireflies is in a different league. A film that is once seen and never forgotten a film that is beautiful haunting and emotionally devastating. It is slow moving perhaps and ""depressing"" but it is very poignant as well. I find it very difficult to fight back tears at the film's end. The animation is amazingly detailed the backgrounds and characters are drawn with such care and you just marvel at the detail that goes into it. The music is both haunting and melancholic and one of the main reasons why the film is as it is. The story is harrowing as it details Seita and Setsuko's hopelessness. The characters are easy to relate Setsuko isn't precocious or obnoxious instead she is quite cute and Seita shows real love for his sister as well as being a strong protagonist. There are many memorable sequences but one that springs to mind is the one with the nocturnal fireflies which is something of true melancholic beauty. Overall a masterpiece pure and simple. 10/10 Bethany Cox",3 April 2010
One of the finest films ever made.,Occasionally there's a film that literally changes one's perceptions of the world. 'Grave of the Fireflies' is one of those films. No movie ever made generates such an intense and powerful emotional response as this one.It's an animated film set in Japan during the closing days of World War II. Two children; a boy named Seita and his much younger sister Setsuko; must quickly learn to cope with life after their mother is killed during a fire-bombing raid by American B-29's. The film starts with the children and their mother preparing for the attack then follows the children as they attempt to survive the death of their mother and the possible death of their father a naval officer serving aboard the Japanese heavy cruiser 'Maya.' (A US submarine torpedoed the 'Maya' in late October of 1944 during the battle of Leyte Gulf.)The story of two orphans trying to survive in war-ravaged Japan is not the subject of your typical light-hearted animated film. In fact it may be much too serious for anyone under the age of 14. The first five minutes of the film hits one like a sledgehammer - by far the most emotional opening scene I've ever come across. I found myself already reaching for the tissues and trying to choke back the tears.Yet there's more than just tragedy in 'Grave of the Fireflies.' It is the most awesome love story one is ever likely to see. But it's far from the typical Hollywood idea of a love story. Instead of the usual highly attractive Hollywood actors of the opposite sex pining for one another in front of the camera we have an animated Japanese brother and his much younger little sister. It's not a tale of romantic love but one of 'brotherly' love.Seita loves his little sister and once he discovers that his mother has been killed in the bombing he does everything he can to keep his sister from finding out about her horrible death. Then with typical Japanese seriousness he begins to immediately provide for and comfort Setsuko; she being the only member of his immediate family he has left. Though not stated in the film it seems obvious that part of Seita's motivation for looking so carefully after his sister has to do with avoiding his own pain and despair having been left with NOTHING after the bombing attack. No mother no father no home. The war Japan is waging against the rest of the world takes its toll on these two little ones without regard for their feelings or emotions.That which truly broke my heart into ten thousand tiny pieces was the selfless way Seita looked after his younger sister and shielded her from the horrors all around especially the lack of food. Films show us many things some good some evil but rarely has any film shown how one person so unselfishly puts another ahead of them self. Seita does makes some mistakes in the way he goes about taking care of his sister but I can't fault him for his love and his devotion. Who of us have always chosen the best path the most perfect way of doing things? Surely not I! Seita's obvious love and devotion to Setsuko is the most moving and convicting thing I've ever come across on film.I use the word 'convicting' because this movie convicted me of my own very selfish nature. 'Grave of the Fireflies' caused me sadness not just because of Seita's brave attempts to take care of his little sister; but because he gave of himself so totally and completely even though his sister was a liability to his own survival. I could not help to be convicted concerning all the many times there have been family and friends who have needed my help or understanding but I ignored them in favor of 'doing my own thing.' How sad I am for all those times I've ignored the suffering of others and their cries for help. This film showed the evil in my own heart - something that I would not have noticed on my own. But now that the blinders have been removed I can repent of my selfishness and look for ways to help others instead of avoiding them.Some Japanese anime I've seen are very much anti-American. But even though it's the Americans dropping the bombs in this film there is no overt anti-American message. In many ways the Japanese civilians are shown in as bad a light as is the American air and naval forces! Their hard hearts and stubborn ways are displayed on the screen without apology; and one can see how the plight of the two children is made even worst by the selfishness of the adults that they have come to rely upon.It would be easy for someone from 'the West' (i.e. The USA Canada Western Europe Australia etc.) to think that the two children depicted in this animated marvel were the exception rather than the rule. They lived in very trying times and surely children in this day and age do not have to go through experiences similar to Seita's and Setsuko's. Unfortunately that's not the case. There are still major problems with orphans and unwanted children in the former communist block countries of Eastern Europe and Russia itself. There are also large numbers of unwanted children roaming the streets of China India Mongolia and various other Asian nations. We may not here about it on the news or hear our friends talk about it; but I assure you that there are literally millions of children around the world whose situation is no better if not much worst than that of Seita and Setsuko.I am very thankful I had the honor of watching this film. I'm also very thankful for the people who put it together. But most of all I'm very thankful for the positive impact it has had on my life.,7 December 1999
Heartbreaking...,This film proves without any doubt that animation isn't just suited to tales of fantasy sci-fi or cartoon comedy and violence. This absolutely heartbreaking Japanese anime tells the story of a young boy Seito and his younger sister Setsuko as they attempt to survive the American bombings on Japan in the last year of World War II.The story itself based on a true story is powerful enough but the decision to animate the film truly elevates this film to a higher level. This would have been a powerful enough live action drama along the lines of Spielberg's Empire of the Sun or even Schindler's List. However the Studio Ghibli team have brought an extraordinary amount of life to all the characters but especially the young siblings. Now we're not talking realism as such here - the characters are in no way photo-realistic they do have the usual characteristics of Japanese anime humans large eyes and exaggerated expressions. What this achieves however is a heightened level of subtle nuances in expression which are arguably more powerful and provocative than anything a real-life actor may achieve. Some may claim this is overly manipulative or sentimental but coupled with the characters movements and actions it gives the characters such a strong and very human presence. You truly care for these kids which is an astonishing achievement. The voice cast (original Japanese) contributes significantly here also.It is the tiny moments which give this film so much power and emotional depth - from subtle expressions to brief scenes showing Seito playing with his sister at bath time attempting unsuccessfully to cheer her up when she misses her mother. The painted backgrounds are works of art in themselves just beautiful. And of course the scenes with the fireflies bring a touch of pure magic - a heightened innocent reality to contrast the horrific realities of the war.The greatest achievement of this film is that apart from a couple of obviously sentimental scenes such as Setsuko's sobbing or illness it doesn't force any false emotion on the viewer. It really comes from your involvement with the characters. It's completely honest to it's own story and even cuts off scenes abruptly which could potentially have been milked for cheap sentiment. It often seems to say - This is what happened you don't need to see anymore. Another of it's strengths is that it really doesn't comment on the politics of the war in any way just the effects on innocent people.This is an intensely moving film and a masterpiece of animation. If you aren't moved by these characters you really need to check your pulse. 10/10,3 January 2006
Greatest War Film?,A tragic film covering a young boy and his little sister's struggle to survive in Japan during World War II.Apparently people including Roger Ebert consider this one of the greatest -- or perhaps the greatest -- war film ever made. Now that is interesting because it is a cartoon. You never expect that and this might not be something you want to show kids. It is pretty bold with wounded people maggots and anyone can die.Even more interesting is how it takes place from the point of view of a Japanese youth during World War II. He is not nationalistic he is not anti-American he is just a kid. And is that not the truth of war? No matter who is right or wrong millions of kids become the victims.,17 December 2014
Utterly devastating,It's better not to learn too much about this film before watching it for fear of spoiling it. I'd heard it described as the saddest film of all time but even that didn't prepare me for what I saw.Speaking from the point of view of somebody who avoids animation as much as possible I found this to be a piece of exceptional film-making. Use as many superlatives as you like: amazing engrossing compelling outstanding it all boils down to one important thing - this film tells a story that grips us with its exploration of the human condition. I imagine virtually everybody who watches it will be able to identify with it in some way or other.So forget this one's a cartoon and just go into it expecting a tale packed with emotion and feeling. And if you have to go back and watch the beginning again after you've seen it all the way through that's fine too.,10 February 2011
Depressing but a must see,One of the great animated films of all time Grave of Fireflies tells the story of a couple of kids as the try to survive in war time Japan. What happens to them should be seen by anyone thinking of starting a war since it tells very graphically what happens to those often forgotten the children.Like its companion piece Barefoot Gen which tells the story of survivors of atomic bombing and the horrors that were experienced by those unlucky enough not to have been killed out right this film proves that war is hell for everyone especially the children.Its very hard to send anyone out to see this unhappy little film (The previously mentioned Barefoot Gen spawned sequels this has not) but at the same time you owe it to yourself to experience however distantly what sort of monster we unleash upon the world every time we go to war. It helps that however depressing this is its also a damn good and incredibly compelling story.9 out of 10,6 July 2004
A magnificent piece of work and one of the most heartbreaking tales ever told,Animation is often seen as a childish medium and for good reason as kid's films often are animated. However every now and then an animated film comes along that extends it's boundaries and manages to deliver a very adult story and Grave of the Fireflies is one of those films. Through it's well observed and very real characters Grave of the Fireflies portrays a story of loss heartbreak and the effect of war on civilians in a manner that is more effective and more firmly based in reality than many live action films about the same subject are. We follow Seita and Setsuko a brother and sister that have lost their parents in the war and are now forced to fend for themselves in the war torn country. How the two go about doing that and the boy's development from a child to a (somewhat) responsible adult due to the change in the surroundings makes up the spine of the movie.I'm not a big fan of animation but there are some films that are so great that a person's personal preferences are irrelevant and this is one of those films. The animation is beautiful and certain scenes including the air raids and anything with the fireflies are amazing works of art. The way the music blends with the images on screen is haunting and beautiful and helps add to the tragedy of the story. Because we are able to care for the characters the tragedy is increased ten fold and the story on the whole is a sad one but few movies have ever matched up to this film's ending in terms of pure despair. The conclusion is absolutely gut wrenching to an extent that few movies have ever matched let alone animated pictures. The fact that it's so plain and blatant with no attempt to console the audience takes the tragedy to a whole new level and I don't doubt that many audience members will be holding back tears upon the film's conclusion.This film is a must see.,7 January 2005
The best movie you'll never want to see again,"I had the fortune of being able to see Hotaru no Haka on the big-screen in Seattle a couple of years ago. It was truly the high-point of my film festival excursions. At the end of the movie there was silence absolute and total silence in the theater - and then only an occasional sniffle until the end credits had finished rolling and the house lights came up. It would've seemed almost disrespectful to profane the silence with words.Seeing a movie like this really changes attitudes about war - about who really suffers and that the honor and glory is shallow comfort when you contemplate what has been lost in the struggle.I've made the comment to my friends that if you ever see someone who isn't moved (usually to tears) by this movie you've found someone without a soul. As difficult as it is to watch turn off the phone dim the lights and immerse yourself in the film with ones you love - you will be a better person for it in the end.There are many other reviews of this movie and most of them are probably far more comprehensive than my own - I'll conclude by saying that this movie should required viewing at some point (as should the peace museums at Hiroshima and Nagasaki) for everyone.When you see war and conflict in the news or read about it in the paper think back to this movie - your perspective will probably be broadened and your eyes opened a bit more.I've only watched this movie about 4 times - it usually takes a year or so to ""decompress"" after watching it. To see it too often would lessen the impact and that would be the worst possible thing to do to this movie.",26 August 2001
Heartbreaking,During my searches on Anime on the net one day I came across this title. This was 2 years ago.Then last week I went to an Anime convention and at the DVD stand I saw it. I bought it immediately.When I got home 3 days later I popped it in. I was warned about it being tragic but nothing could have prepared me for the wave of emotion that hit me while watching it. I was depressed for a whole day. Even thinking about it made me cry..This is the power of Grave Of The Fireflies..This is not your typical Dragonball Z/Sailormoon/Pokemon style anime. While I love Sailormoon and some Dragonball Z Grave Of The Fireflies surpasses it by lightyears. I bought it expecting an epic movie like Ghost In The Shell or Akira but even those paled compared to this.We have here a story of a 14 year old boy(Seita) who loses his mother in a firebombing during World War 2. He then has to take care of his 4 year old sister(Setsuko). While at first they're taken in by his aunt the relationship between him and his aunt takes a turn for the worst. He then ends up on the street and the struggle begins... It doesn't take a genious to figure out that things get really depressing yet I won't spoil the ending..All I have left to say is that you have to see this movie.. It's the most powerful movie I've ever seen... It's painful to watch but still you have to see it...,4 March 2001
Soul Breaking,This is a film about the sad reality of war. When war is waged we often think of it as this army against that army. Lost in the mix are the civilians who die horrible deaths--not just from the weapons of war but from disease and starvation. We give great power to the power structure that makes the decision to wage conflict. Often their words sound good and we embrace those words. This film shows what happens to a small seemingly insignificant pair of children trying to get a roof over their heads and have a bit to eat. Their mother has been killed in a fire bombing and their father is in the Japanese navy. It shows the efforts to maintain dignity and the cruelty of those who could help but don't. Japan paid a huge price for trying to expand the Empire. The leadership convinced the populace that they were driven by a higher power that wanted them to crush their enemies at whatever cost. But here we see the price. Fire bombings air raids and of course eventually Hiroshima and Nagasaki. This is the saddest of stories shown in spotless animation. It is a story of hope and hopelessness. Outstanding.,9 February 2021
Heart breaking animation,This animated movie starts with young boy Seita dying on the floor of a train station after Japan surrenders in WWII. His spirit leads the audience to his story with his little sister Setsuko. During an air raid on their home town they lose their mother. Their father is away with the Navy. The siblings go to live with their unsympathetic aunt. Seita clash with her and the siblings go live by themselves in the bomb shelter next to the waters. It doesn't go well as their lives deteriorate to the point where Seita dies alone on the floor.It is the saddest of tragedy. The animation is the perfect foil to the subject matter. The animation style is children's story but the movie is all too realistic. The characters are not cartoons. It is ripped from the pages of history. The children animation style draws the audience in and it hits the viewer in the heart.,9 May 2014
Brutally honest and heartbreaking,Being my first Anime review I thought I'd start off with my one of my favourite pieces of work from who else but Studio Ghibli. Ghibli have rarely produced anime that doesn't fall short of great but Graveyard is something different indeed.Set in the aftermath of World War II Graveyard is focused on the lives of a caring brother and his young sister (Setsuko and Seita) and how they struggle against both the elements of wartime and a depreciating Japanese empire. The most striking thing about Graveyard is probably how real everything seems. The animation is very unconventional to the likes of say Spirited Away or Laputa but in a good way. The horror of war is beautifully realised through the animation whether it be the American destruction being shown or the bleak outlook on peoples lives namely the two main characters. Thankfully it earns every shred of emotion it conveys through these two sympathetic characters that only the coldest of hearts wouldn't warm up to. Avoiding any Hollywood sentimentality it is often a bleak and depressing perspective depicted but all the more brutally powerful in the process. With my eyes welling up through the duration of the film it occured to me just how well the Director understands what raw heartfelt emotion is and how to play the audiences heart strings. Nevertheless nothing is shown in a heavy handed approach no empthasis is put on the Americans nor is there any special attention taken to the war details. If anything the citizens of Japan are shown in the coldest light often giving little help to the plight of others but demonstrating furthermore what desperate situation everyone is in.Takahata instead decides to focus on the plight of it's title characters against the background of war. With the empire of Japan in crisis and food shortages everywhere it is heart breaking to see a brother struggle to meet ends meet for his sister. Due to the approach taken it borders on being horrifying but fortunately the tone is changed with the spirit put into Setsuko's character. Much like 'The Pianist' the issue is not the war but the struggle and will to survive in it. This is clearly displayed in a plot that revolves around the downward spiral Setsuko trying to feed himself and more importantly the younger and more vulnerable sister Seita. The animation though detailed and indeed beautiful in some sequences (namely relating to the title) is not by any means flashy but captures emotions and interactions between the characters perfectly. It's the perfect mixture of such animation realistic and highly likeable characters that makes the whole film one tearful experience. Dealing with such difficult issues it's very hard to imagine this being a film and if it was I don't think it would of been done as well.Part of the brilliance also comes from symbology and the association to many different worlds in such a understanding depiction. The child Seita is nothing short of perfection in child like behaviour happily oblivious to the desperate situation amusing herself with simplicity and the quirks of nature and the outdoors. The older brother Setsuko who must carry the burdon of everything is also perfectly portrayed and to watch there decent is painful to say the least. To struggle is one thing but to have shock shattered dreams and be depended on is something anyone can empthasise with. There may be some people who will shy away from Anime disregarding it as a mere cartoon. To those people and everyone else I recommend Graveyard as the tonic which can be appreciated by anyone with a heart and soul. Among the finest pieces of Anime created and one of the most touching war films ever made.,9 October 2003
Heartrendering moving masterpiece from Isao Takahata and a triumph for animation.,"Truly one of Studio Ghibli's greatest crowning achievements GRAVE OF THE FIREFLIES is a brilliant masterpiece fully deserving of a place in any of the best movies ever made. Not just an astonishingly great (and at the risk of coming off as cliché perfect) work of art this is a moving thought-provoking and ultimately heartbreaking tale about the loss of innocence and the tragedies of war.Based on an autobiography by Akiyuki Nosaka the film set during the bombing of Japan in --of all times-- World War II centers on Seita a loving headstrong Navy soldier's son and his innocent little sister Setsuko. Their fatal struggle for survival begins right at the start when both are bombed out of house and home by American B-29s. Mom is seriously wounded and found wrapped in bandages at a hospital where she dies shortly after. The children move to Nishinomiya to stay with their aunt. Auntie a cold bitter self-serving woman has no patience with Seita or Setsuko especially when they would rather chase after fireflies at moonlight play by the beach or lounge around the house instead of helping out. After butting heads with Auntie long enough the children decide to run away setting up home in an abandoned cave by the lake. Both try by all means to live off of vegetables or whatever food they can afford to trade and/or steal to no avail....The outcome of the story is actually showcased at the opening of the movie where we see a ghostly specter of Seita watching a more malnourished version of himself die a painful lonely death at a train station. Indeed as we see how these events came to pass we find ourselves rooting for Seita and Setsuko to find a way to stay alive but alas it is not to be given Seita's stubborn pride. The overall tone of the movie is of a very tragic nature--even such lighthearted moments as the aforementioned sequences involving Seita and Setsuko playing around the house or gathering fireflies as lights for their cave are all tainted with a touch of sadness for we know that these brief scenes of happiness will not last.Who is to blame for the plight of these children? The movie never addresses this question to the audience nor does it really care to. It would be easy for director Isao Takahata to make this an anti-American movie but he does better than that. Instead he aptly conveys that war can spell serious--and deadly--consequences for victims. He also eschews casting any character as a hero or villain and instead makes this a very human story with no clear-cut ""good"" or ""bad"" characters. The aunt for example is not evil; she is merely an angry desperate woman who is only struggling to survive just as much as Seita and Setsuko are. Atrocious as her treatment of the children is we somehow never see her as a true baddie but a very flawed multi-faceted human being.Normally one would think of this kind of story as suitable for live-action but GRAVE OF THE FIREFLIES proves that it can be told through the art of animation as well. This is no mindless showcase of gorgeous visuals--although the artistic merits of the movie are as with Ghibli productions sumptuous and at times breathtaking--but a display of real characters struggling with very tangible emotions. And the most amazing accomplishment about this movie is how much we grow to care for Seita and Setsuko--their inseparable bond of love and companionship is the heart and soul behind the movie.There are long stretches of silence on the soundtrack with music used very sparingly yet the movie is all the more powerful for it. The most effective moment is where we hear a scratchy rendition of ""Home Sweet Home"" over a montage of Setsuko playing by the shelter. It's a simplistic sweet yet very saddening moment that not only works in the context of the movie but on its own as well.I don't normally say this in my reviews but I would definitely recommend watching this movie in its native language of Japanese for a truly powerful and memorable experience. That's not to imply however that the English dub produced by New York-based Central Park Media is inferior; on the contrary. It is in fact surprisingly good with an effective lead in J. Robert Spencer and noteworthy cameo appearances by Anime voice-over actors Veronica Taylor Crispin Freeman and Dan Green. Rhoda Chrosite's Setsuko is the one voice that doesn't fare so well; she sounds more like an adult pretending to be a young girl and comes across as strained during most scenes (save for when she is sick from diarrhea). Still for those who can't read subtitles the dub is more than adequate (although not as high-profile as others that I've heard).Even in a genre as multi-faceted as Japanese Anime there are few films that literally everyone really MUST see. GRAVE OF THE FIREFLIES is one such movie.",18 August 2005
One for the unknown victims.,Just marvellous! This hearty masterpiece of Japanese animation is incredibly moving sincere haunting and captivating in detailing the special bond between brother and sister caught up in the horrifying and unforgiving face of war. It guides us on one really tragic but rewarding trip where it truly has an impact. Never does it get overwrought or push itself onto the viewer but still it manages to leave a lump in your throat and have you emotionally drained when the credits begin to roll. This one is not afraid to stay gloomy and because you know the outcome at the beginning this makes the significance of the story's journey more potentate in its increasing pain and devastation. By that alone the wonderfully textured plot doesn't take the easy way out and the reality of the situation is never lost because it's animated.Staying simple and focused kept it rather flawless in its in-depth story telling of emotional pride and lasting effects. Slow it might be but there's too much subtle richness within its characters premise and visuals to really bother about the loose pacing and lack of action. Isao Takahata adapts the novel of Akiyuki Nosaka and gets us deeply involved with the civilians and the mere war stays in the background. A contrast between two different worlds one being the war itself and secondly the one the two children find themselves in to forget it. Namely those scenes where they're experiencing the beauty and freeness of nature (at if they might never get that chance again) and those sequences with the fireflies admirably paint the feelings of what's to come. The budding relationship between Seita and Setsuko is tremendously done innocent and full of colour. Even capturing the Japanese citizens and families in this cold plight is believability achieved as it throws questions issues and metaphorical messages. These people (including our two central characters) are doing it hard but their wills won't collapse after what they've been through but things do take their toll when everything you ever care for can suddenly vanish and the heartache turns to utter numbness. Because what kept you living is no longer there to hold you.Breathing heavily on the mood is the soft lovely musical score that certainly weeps with its melodic tone. The vivid animation is gorgeously crisp and enchanting and the background scenery is profoundly vivid and convincing. Many beautiful striking illustrations are framed with a sincere touch where darkness treads neatly together with the lighter moments. What a delightfully effective and soulful meditation piece of sublime art by director/writer Isao Takahata. This one has plenty to say on the topic at hand and it gets even more relevant everyday.Magnificently heart-wrenching and sensitive war-time story on the people who find themselves dealing with the unbearable consequences of war.,8 August 2007
I can hardly see through the tears. Great drama anime.,"This is a war time story and while it has a slow pace it couldn't have been told any other way. It's like a knife being slowly inserted and twisted in the wound.Everything begins with a ""La Vitta e Bella"" atmosphere: mother dead father at war brother and little sister going to a distant relative brother sheltering the sister from the realities of war as much as possible. But the end of the film (which again doesn't come abruptly but gradually) is nothing like happy.This has no action scenes no fight or physical violence scenes no sci-fi and no fiction. It's an anime harsh reality that makes you cry your eyes off at the end of the movie. The movie is great it's a must see for anime lovers or anybody else.I recommend to see again the start of the film after you have seen the whole movie.",11 June 2005
Haunting,I was warned this movie would be emotional but I had no idea just how understated that was. By the end my friend and I were huddled together pouring out tears I've never shed for any movie before. It was a mix of horror empathy sadness and so many more emotions I can't even begin to list.Visions of this film have haunted me since first watching it and I would find it hard to watch again simply from it being so heart-wrenching. Only one movie has ever hit me hard enough to keep me from subjecting myself to it's strong emotions again (The thief the cook his wife and her lover).I strongly urge all to watch this as it rises well about any films I've seen anime or not.,28 January 2001
More moving than you could ever expect,This film is utterly emotionally draining whilst being rewarding at the same time.The animation is both realistic and stylized but that's not the point the main focus of this film is the character development of the brother and sister protagonists. Their relationship is nothing short of beautiful and touching.And without spoiling anything I have to say that this film touched me in a way no other film has ever touched me in my adult life. One or two films have upset me and reduced me to watery eyes but Grave of the Fireflies had me in fits of sobbing despair. I was a mess! I'm talking total emotional breakdown. Couldn't talk without sobbing! One of the best films I have EVER seen animated or not.,3 February 2005
once upon a time in Japan,"Hiroshima may have been the most famous bombing of Japan but the air raids were often just as destructive. One such firebombing is the setting of Isao Takahata's ""Hotaru no Haka"" (""Grave of the Fireflies"" in English). It looks at both the struggle for survival and loss of innocence that accompany war. I've never seen any other anime but is one movie that should truly be required viewing for everyone. Not only in looking at how the brother and sister try to maintain their hope amid hardship but two lines in particular stood out. One is where someone mentions that the war is eating up Japan's resources making it harder and harder to feed the people. Another is when the brother learns that Japan has surrendered. Long taught that the Japanese Empire was invincible he now has to realize the unpleasant truth. These are important reminders for everyone. The fact remains that the common people will suffer the most in any war and the movie makes that very clear.Like I said a movie that everyone should see.",10 January 2013
"""Hard to recover from impossible to forget""","This is one of those reviews where I will say at the outset that if you haven't yet seen the film you should go see it. As soon as (or even before if you're the impatient type) you read this review I urge you to run out and buy or rent it.Because my words simply cannot convey what Isao Takahata's animated masterpiece Hotaru no haka conveys.Known in the English-speaking world as Grave of the Fireflies or in some countries Tombstone for Fireflies Hotaru no haka is the single most powerful anti-war film I have ever seen. As a work of art it ranks among Picasso's Guernica and Elgar's cello concerto. It succeeds where many American filmslike Fahrenheit 9/11 Apocalypse Now and even Schindler's Listsimply don't. Hotaru no haka is a grim depiction of innocence lost not just of its two young protagonists but of the entire Japanese nation.The story centers around two children: Seita who is about thirteen; and his younger sister Setsuko who is four. Their mother dies of wounds when their town is attacked during the firebombing of Japan in World War II and they go to live with an aunt. While kind at first she grows to resent the two siblings she must now feed and shelterwhy can't Seita ""work for the war effort"" as his cousin and uncle are doing? Seita and Setsuko eventually set out on their own to live in an abandoned shelter. But food is hard to come by and they gradually succumb to malnutrition.Yes they die. That is obvious from the film's exposition which shows Seita sitting ragged and obviously malnourished in a train station a mysterious tin on his person. A janitor throws the tin into the night where fireflies encircle it and the spirit of Setsuko emerges. She joins her brother's ghost they board a train to the next world and the story is told in flashback. ""September 21 1945... that was the night I died"" is the opening line.The interesting thing about this film is that although it is Japanese it neither victimizes the Japanese nor demonizes the Americans. In fact its deepest disdain is reserved perhaps for the Japanese people themselves who turn a cold shoulder to the suffering of their children and fellow citizens. Takahata shows us that the true casualty of war is not life but innocence.The animation while in the stylized animé tradition is rooted in realism and rich detail; and while it strikingly depicts the tragic demise of the characters it also has many moments of beauty. There is much to be admired visually in this filmhardly surprising since it comes from Japan's legendary Studio Ghibli which has produced the most breathtaking traditional animation that I have ever had the privilege to see.All these elementsstory symbolism animationcombine to make one big emotional punch in the gut that is hard to recover from and impossible to forget. It's an animated film sure; but it is one of the most bitingly real films you'll ever see and the simple fact that it is not live-action doesn't diminish its power. If you have a night to ruin watch Hotaru no haka. It's a film that you don't want to see but one that you will never regret having seen.My inevitable ""dub vs. sub"" commentary: The DVD contains two versions of the film: one is a dubbed English version and the other is the original Japanese with English subtitles. I urge you to do yourself a favor and watch the Japanese version. I see no point in watching the dub since you won't be showing Hotaru no haka to younger children anyways....right?",25 September 2005
Heartbreakingly Beautiful,I'd heard that this film was very sad before I saw it and knew how it ended but that didn't prepare me for just how harrowing this film was.Instead of focusing on the military this war film focuses on two children Seita a boy in his early teens and Setsuko his four year old sister. The action is not fast paced as we follow the children's lives from the death of their mother in a fire-bombing raid through a stay with an unpleasant aunt and trying to live on their own in an abandoned air raid shelter to their inevitable end. By taking it slowing and showing the mundane aspects of their lives the viewer grows to care about the characters especially the delightful Setsuko to such an extent that that I was smiling during flash backs showing her playing while simultaneously sobbing at her loss.This is not a film to be watched if one is depressed but it should certainly be seen by as many people as possible at least once it may show two children in war torn Japan but it could easily be set in any war zone at any time in history.,8 April 2008
Eff you movie.,Seriously. I just...I can't even with you. Oh sure you're absolutely perfect in every possible way but still...I can't. I honestly wish I'd never watched you and your beautiful difficult sadness. Ugh. Where's my daughter? I need to hold her. Forever....sigh. Seriously...eff you.,7 May 2018

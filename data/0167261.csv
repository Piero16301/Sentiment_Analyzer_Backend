An Epic in every sense of the word.,"Peter Jackson truly outdid himself when creating the Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring and he fails to disappoint us in the 2nd part of the Trilogy. The Two Towers shows us that he is not a one-hit wonder like so many directors are. I actually think that The Two Towers reaches the same level as the Fellowship of the Ring and sometimes even surpasses it.This film is the biggest film in the trilogy. What do I mean by that? Well this film has so many things going like the amazing Battle of Helms Deep. Frodo and Sam journey to Mount Doom to destroy the Ring. But the one who's leading them through the way is Gollum he looks so creepy and realistic that he doesn't feel disconnected from us. A powerful performance by Andy Serkis as Gollum he should of been nominated for an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor.The Best part of the film is quite easily and everyone knows it the ending. The ending of the battle of Helm's Deep is quite breathtaking and as Gandalf the White comes in the distance with another army to defeat the Orcs. When Treebeard and his army of Entz tear down Isengard the destruction and the battle is so immense in size that you truly have to see to believe.In size and scale Peter Jackson has truly redefined the word ""epic"" and he also pays attention to the small things that truly elevate this movie from great to amazing. I definitely recommend this film to everyone but you really should watch the first movie to truly understand what's going on.10/10",12 August 2010
"""There's some good in this world Mr. Frodo and it's worth fighting for.""","""The Lord of the Rings"" continues it's epic quest in this second installment of the trilogy as the original fellowship is disbanded and it's various members must continue the good fight. While Frodo and Sam pursue their mission to Mordor Pippin and Merry manage to escape the Uruk hai into the Fangorn Forest and their own adventure with the Ents. Aragorn Legolas and Gimli traverse the Riddermark into the realm of Rohan.The One Ring begins to deepen it's spell over Frodo who questions his worthiness and stomach for the mission. This facet of his character allows Sam (Sean Astin) to portray his devotion and loyalty to his master particularly when Gollum makes his appearance and becomes their guide. Gollum's looks are rivaled only by his treachery and the duality of his personality is given emphasis in the tortured conversations he has with himself. I was a bit surprised at the way Gollum was portrayed in ""The Two Towers""; his cameo appearance in the first film as a slinky black cave denizen more closely resembled Tolkien's description and corresponded to the mental image I took away when reading about it. At the same time though there was almost a comic element to it whereas his physical features presented here more accurately allowed for a menacing but tortured creature.Even more fantastic creatures find CGI life in the film; I found the presentation of the Ents to be masterfully done. The ""olyphants"" were a neat touch and I was happy to see them included. Of course the orcs wargs and Uruk hai all personify the evil that befalls Middle Earth in this dire time and their presence instills fear and dread for the heroes all along the way.There's a lot going on in the film and repeated viewings are helpful along with an understanding created by reading Tolkien's story. Though not entirely necessary to enjoy the movie I feel it grounds the viewer in the rich background of the characters and locations. Actually the books and the film complement each other nicely even though the movie of necessity must leave out some elements.There is no doubt that ""The Lord of the Rings"" has earned it's reputation as one of the greatest epic films of all time and the best fantasy film of them all. At the same time it does a wonderful job of examining such themes as honor loyalty friendship and love as it's characters interact with each other and find common ground against a threat to their very existence.",28 December 2005
Great movie,Great movie I really enjoyed watching and better than the first part,28 September 2020
They Accomplished the Near-Impossible.,"""The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"" is another excellent installment in the thus far excellent trilogy. The film picks up immediately where ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" left off as Elijah Wood and Sean Astin continue their long and seemingly hopeless journey to destroy the One Ring in the fires of Mordor. They run into the creature Gollum (played amazingly by Andy Serkis in a revolutionary character-generation). Serkis' motives are unclear as the ring has literally run him insane and created a split personality that combats the character's natural good side. Meanwhile Billy Boyd and Dominic Monaghan have escaped the dark forces that captured them but now are in another dilemma as they try to convince a forest of living moving trees to support their cause for good and truth. Viggo Mortensen Orlando Bloom and John Rhys-Davies receive more help from the likes of Bernard Hill's army and his lovely niece (Mirando Otto). As all this occurs Ian McKellen comes back and rehashes a role which seemed to have expired late in the first film. Hugo Weaving and daughter Liv Tyler know that victory is not certain and realize that they must leave their true homes forever to protect themselves and the lives of their people. Christopher Lee continues to create chaos with the help of the highly disturbed Brad Dourif (of ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" fame). In the end not one but two key battles will create the sure-to-be electrifying landscape which will be experienced by all in the franchise's final installment (""The Return of the King""). Many view ""The Two Towers"" as an achievement even more impressive than its predecessor. True the film does go beyond the technical faculties of ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" but it is hard for me to pick this installment over the first (which will likely always be my favorite). This film is more intense and you get the feeling of real danger and peril throughout while the first was more of an emotional experience due to its nice elements of friendship love and personal sacrifice. In short ""The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"" is an amazing sequel and it fits in well with the outstanding first film. 5 stars out of 5.",25 March 2003
One of The Best battle sequence.,Even if I watched this movie like more than 20 times still I feel nearly the same as I first watch.Can you imagine a movie can make you feel always the same. You're feeling that desperate hopeless times with the Rohan soldiers.The first half of the movie is going slow I think that brings realistic style to the movie even if it is a Fantasy genre movie.As you may know Tolkien is still the best at world creation on a Fantasy world. And he's too good at writing battle sequences. I don't know the reason can be the World War that he fought in. He's making so remarkable battle sequences. And in the movie Peter Jackson and his crew did an amazing job with adaptation.The great cast that chosen well shows you don't need big stars all the time.Howard Shore's brilliant Original Scores makes the movie much more effective.Cinematography is the most important thing when we're talking about visuals. The rainy night shots are just amazing. Academy Award winner Andrew Lesnie did really great job.The VFX and SFX is just magnificent stunning quality. You know the VFX is just revolutionary that's clear. Because it is the foundation of Motion Capture technology.That Set Decoration is beyond revolutionary. Makes you feel like Helm's Deep and nearly all the other places feels real.,3 March 2023
Helm's Deep could be the greatest battle sequence of all time.,As you know Tolkien did a great job with creating the world. Also did a perfect job with writing the battles. Also It's not that easy to fitting that to the adaptation. The whole cast did pretty perfect job with The Two Towers. I know whole Trilogy made in same time. Only the film editors are changing through the trilogy. So they managed a great job making these movies.I think The Siege of Minas-Tirith sequence is also pretty good and flawless. But the horror and darkness is so effective in The Helm's Deep Battle. You may predict the Rohan People are going to win they're the good guys after all. But even if you are watching this movie second time you will feel that hopeless times again.The first half of the movie feels slow I think that brings realistic style to a fantasy movie. Of course there is too important scenes in the first half of the movie I'm saying the most important scenes are in the second half of the movies. This goes for all three movies.Tell me how can a movie achieve this much? Costume Design Makeup Art Direction & Set Decoration Film Editing VFX SFX Scores. The Trilogy manages to be revolutionary nearly all of that. At least it is Revolutionary in 5 of them. Some movies made me love some genres The Lord of the Rings made me love the Cinema.,2 March 2023
My personal favourite of the trilogy,I do love all three films of The Lord of the Rings trilogy all are visually stunning with wonderful music and strong narratives. The Two Towers is my personal favourite of the three for several reasons. For one thing it is less talky than Fellowship of the Ring and the pace is a little more secure here. Also the final battle is just breathtaking in the action direction and in its scope and very compelling and epic. And some of the characters are developed more here than they were in Fellowship of the Ring primarily Frodo and Aragorn who were played very well there but a little bland in comparison to here. When it comes to the scope The Two Towers is possibly the biggest in the trilogy. The cinematography is one of the strongest assets while the scenery costumes lighting and make up(the orcs look amazing) are all gorgeous. You can tell a lot of effort went into this and it showed. The music is also darker and perhaps more complex the story is richer and compelling and the dialogue is thought provoking. People may disagree but I think The Two Towers is the best directed of the trilogy too.The acting is very good. Elijah Wood is likable enough with a stronger-written character while Sean Astin's bumbling persona suits Sam really well. Viggo Mortensson is as strong and charismatic as ever. Ian McKellen Christopher Lee and Bernard Hill are also perfectly cast but the real revelation in my view with this movie is Gollum. Here Gollum is designed superbly and Andy Serkis's performance is absolutely phenomenal and Oscar-nod worthy.In conclusion a fine film and for me my personal favourite of the trilogy. 10/10 Bethany Cox,8 March 2011
Great,The Two Towers is worth watching just to see the Battle of Helm's Deep. It is one of the most impressive battle sequences to hit the big screen. But then there's so much more than that-this movie also features amazing special effects with Gollum dramatic political tension in Rohan and fantastic moments with the Ents. This is probably my favorite chapter of the Lord of the Rings film trilogy.,15 February 2020
Absolutely totally fantastic!,"Watching this movie is like watching a 179 or 223 minutes long action sequence. The pace is incredibly high. Alright I have to admit that the Extended Edition of the ""The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"" takes an awful lot of this pace away and make some of the scene's unnecessary long and the scene's with Treebeard are also a bit dull and long but still...Especially compared to the first that was just too slow at times this is an huge improvement!Luckily there also are some welcome additions in the Extended Edition. Best addition are the scene's with Boromir Faramir and Denethor in Osgiliath.There also are some newly great characters and actors. David Wenham is a surprisingly talented young actor and I think it's great that they actually have cast someone that really looks like Sean Bean. Bernard Hill also impressed me he probably is best know for his role as the captain in ""Titanic"" in which he also already impressed me. Viggo Mortensen probably still is the best actor of ""The Lord of the Rings"" movies. Yes sure Ian McKellen and Christopher Lee are also more than great but Mortensen really puts some passion and effort in his character. I know Sean Astin is always being praised a lot but I seriously don't think that he is such a good actor in any of ""The Lord of the Rings"" movies. Andy Serkis also was really good as Gollum/Sméagol and I wouldn't had mind seeing him get an Oscar nod.Strange thing is that the Gimli and Legolas suddenly changed into some comical sidekick characters. It was odd to see but it works! They provide some good comical relief at times.Most fantastic thing about the movie is that it's really action filled. The Battle of Helm's Deep truly is fantastic to see. Still favorite and most powerful moment of the movie is when the Ent's march to war. Also the scene's with the riders of Rohan are a true spectacle.I've never been really a big fan of the editing of ""The Lord of the Rings"" movies and this one is no exception. Problem is that Peter Jackson shot way too many hours of footage with as a result that the editors have difficulties picking the right scene's and the length of them.But ""The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"" is one of those movies were the pluses make more than up for the minuses.A spectacular adventure action experience.10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",19 March 2005
Sophomore effort shines as brightly as the first.,After Fellowship the world wondered if Peter Jackson could sustain the momentum. The Two Towers is the shortest segment and the story is split into parallel tales. More characters enter the story including one of the most important. Can Jackson do it? Of course he can.Spoilers: Two Towers sustains the magic of Fellowship while expanding the scope of the story. Gollum enters the picture in full view not shadow and is a triumph to behold.The story cuts back and forth between Merry and Pippin's encounter with Treebeard and the Ents; Gimli Legolas and Aragorn and their attempts to locate the hobbits and free them; and Sam Frodo and Gollum as they move closer to Mordor. Each aspect is well covered without losing track of the other story. Rohan provides the setting for the first great battle (aside from the prologue in Fellowship) and what a battle it is. Gandalf returns much changed from his encounter with the balrog. The evil of Wormtongue appears and Theoden Eowyn and Eomer take the stage.There are many great moments from the mounted battles to Gollum and Smeagol's dialogue Legolas' surf archery to Theoden's cure. Helm's Deep is a spectacular segment that takes one back to the epic films of the past. Darkness looms for Frodo and Sam as Frodo slips deeper under the spell of the ring. He finds new and sometimes strange allies; as well as new foes. His journey becomes more difficult with each step.The quality of the production continues. The Rohirrum are a sight to behold and do conjure images of the lost Anglo-Saxons. The battle scenes are engaging and terrifying. War is depicted with all of its consequences. Your heart is torn as you see the young separated from their parents innocents are killed and destruction abounds. At the same time strength and hope come to those in desperate need and courage comes in the unlikeliest of moments. You find yourself in the lowest depths as all seems lost; and then your heart soars as hope comes at the last moment. This is storytelling at its finest.This is not a sequel it is another chapter in an epic saga. As such it builds on the previous chapter and advances the story. The pace quickens as the conflict rises. The stakes are higher and the danger greater. The audience is on the edge of their seat as darkness looms while the threads of hope begin to weave together. The stage is set for the final battle.,7 January 2005
The battle for Middle Earth is about to begin...,"Peter Jackson himself has admitted The Two Towers was the hardest part of the trilogy to achieve at least in terms of narrative structure since unlike The Fellowship of the Ring it has no proper beginning and no emotionally packed climax (Boromir's death in Fellowship was one of that film's most moving moments). It picks up exactly from where its predecessor ended: the Fellowship is split in three separate groups all with their own problems to take care of:Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) continue their journey to Mordor in order to destroy the One Ring and find an unexpected guide in that item's previous owner vicious creature Gollum (Andy Serkis); Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) Legolas (Orlando Bloom) and Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) reunite with the reborn Gandalf (Ian Mckellen) to save the dying kingdom of Rohan from Saruman's (Christopher Lee) evil clutch; Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd) have a close encounter with the Ents ancient creatures which have unfinished business with a certain bad wizard...This second opus is less talking and more fighting: key characters are reduced to cameos (most notably Galadriel) and new people are quickly introduced so that we can be dragged into some huge battles culminating in the 40-minute long combat at Helm's Deep quite simply the movie's highlight. If however you want more insight on the characters and their motivations get the extended cut whose additional sequences are essential to understand pivotal moments of the third film.Helm's Deep aside the movie's most remarkable element is the mad schizophrenic Gollum. He's got ""ambiguity"" and ""unreliability"" written all over him as we see him struggle with his two personas one the good fella he once was the other a filthy treacherous freak who wants nothing more than his ""preccciousssss"" back (the conversation between the two personalities is one of the most beautiful scenes ever made). He makes us suspicious about his most insignificant gesture and has us thinking the worst may happen in The Return of the King.Not as good as the previous part (at least the theatrical version which I rate 9/10) but still a really good fantasy movie and one of the best pictures of 2002.",12 December 2005
A standing ovation for all concerned.,"It seems ridiculous to want to add my own comments to a slew of others that are already in IMDB's records but I feel like I cannot sleep nor cease the throbbing in my chest until I release some of what I have so recently seen.Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings is one of the bravest projects ever attempted by a filmmaker. Mr Jackson deserves every ovation he will receive every award every bit of the praise and adoration that will be spoken and written.This second installment of the story is a masterpiece in every sense forget your prejudices about the books they are another way of looking at this beautiful story (I know this is slightly against the rules but a I cannot resist saying that a previous writers comment - a comment that compared the Lord of the Rings Films and Books to the difference between Romeo and Juliet in screenplay and ballet formats - was entirely accurate).Gollum was an excellent amalgam so easily could he have been an annoying Jar-Jar-Binks-Alike. Instead the way that Jackson and Serkis (and doubtless many many others) chose to portray the CGI incarnation of ""Smeagol"" was incredibly emotive and powerful. Gollum is profoundly disturbing amusing almost lovable... Not even John Ronald Reuel himself could induce that range of emotions for Smeagol in me...A truly skin-crawling performance by a superb Brad Douris as the evil Grima Wormtongue was just beyond words. Douris _Became_ Wormtongue in a skillful fulfillment of what was already inspired casting.Probably the most definitive casting of this film though was Manchester born Bernard Hill as Theoden King of Rohan. The casting for ""The Two Towers"" makes one shake ones head and wonder in retrospect whether anyone else could have filled these roles. Mr Hill's performance was truly first rate a performance which contributed greatly to ""The Battle of Helms Deep"" scenes which were a spinning tornado of emotions for the viewer.Viggo Mortensen goes from strength to strength. His performance is visceral and yet sensitive. The overriding emotion that Tolkiens vision of Aragorn induced (at least for me) was awe at his heroics. Mortensen's portrayal in Jackson's frame brings new aspects to the Aragorn character. Mortensen's Aragorn is emotionally dextrous to go with his physical dexterity he is sensitive seemingly empathic warmer and more fundamentally human and yet super-human in presence and charisma. ""Definitive"" is not strong enough of a word.If you still view Jackson's epic with scepticism I implore you to put down your preconceptions and your prejudices but most of all put down the books... This is beautiful way to see middle earth don't pass it up - The books are the ultimate fantasy epic - the pictures you draw in your head are better than anything you can imagine but The Lord of the Rings ""The Two Towers"" is one wonderful interpretation of that epic story.Go Laugh Cry and Sit in Awe of this cinematic treat.",19 December 2002
My precious...,Seriously I never thought a movie could get better than the Fellowship of the Ring but it did. This movie should be #1 on the IMDb top 250. This movie as long as it was captivated me from start to finish and those who are not entertained by this movie can not be entertained period. Yes I have read the book. Any chapters cut out at the end of books III and IV will probably themselves in the next installment. If you haven't noticed the beginning of the Two Towers was actually closed the Fellowship of the Ring on the big screen.Gollum was a CG masterpiece. He added some light to this incredibly dark movie. At the same time there are areas where you feel sorry for the poor guy or just want to kill him. Smeagol was probably the most diverse character I've ever seen.Elijah Wood put on a better performance than he did in the first movie as did Sean Astin. Ian McKellen who captivated us in the last movie captivated us even more in this one. Viggo Mortensen John Rhys-Davies and Orlando Bloom made a great trio. They laughed together cried together prospered together and suffered together. This trio gave life to Aragorn Gimli and Legolas. Eowyn expressed her emotions clearly through Miranda Otto. The music need not be discussed. Its greatness speaks for itself.Favorite Scene: The Battle of Helms Deep. Possibly the greatest scene in the book 50% of the trailer and action packed climax to this beautiful movie. The movie like its predecessor fails to bring us closure but that's ok. Closure will come next year. I look forward to the Return of the King.The Two Towers is now my favorite movie of all time.The scale is broken. 10 is not a capacity sufficient enough to hold this movie... my movie... my... precious...,18 December 2002
Magnificent epic,The Fellowship of the Ring was a monumentally entertaining film the Return of the King was an amazing wrap-up to the epic of our times but the most dramatic moment for me came at the end of the Two Towers. After 3 hours of sweeping vistas excellent Shakespearean acting and otherworldly sights and sounds we are treated to a scene that still sends chills down my back and rouses me like nothing since the final scene in Rocky. A lone rider (we all know who) set against the top of a hill massing legions of horsemen behind him. He appears just as the heroes are losing all hope. Once he begins his descent down the hill with his army behind him the camera begins a slow pan over the top and down with them showing the size and scale of their forces. The evil army below looks up with surprise a bright light fills the screen the camera focuses on the lead rider (again we all know who) who lets out a wrenching battle cry the music swells to unbelievable heights and I am swept away like I've never been before.This is cinema at its very best.,5 March 2006
A True Fantasy Movie,From the beginning to the very end the Lord of the Rings trilogy is interesting and enjoyable. The books and the movies alike grasp one's attention as if they were real. You the reader or viewer can sense the pain of the characters their emotions. The trilogy is truly powerful on screen. The second movie however I believe has something the first and third are missing; it feels like a bridge connecting two great islands. There is something unique about it that cannot easily be described. Metaphorically the first movie is say a soldier. The third movie is the path home from war. And the second movie is the act of coming home because it contains the obstacles that must be passed through before achieving the goal. Although not 100% loyal to the written trilogy the movies are done in such a way that the mainstream audience and LOTR fans from before the movies came out can say they were enjoyable and well made.,30 December 2004
My Visit To The Cinema,Don`t you just hate cinemas ? No matter where you sit you always end up surrounded by people who spend their time chatting amongst themselves as to the events on screen 30 seconds before they happen . If we`re after a running commentary we`ll buy the DVD thank you very much . Add to this unattended mad mental kids running around wild . In fact many years ago our local newspaper saw a no holds barred letter of complaint about a screening of 3 MEN AND A LITTLE LADY which referred to foul mouthed juvenile delinquents in the audience . And on top of all this I`m a chainsmoker and cinema chains don`t allow patrons to poison themselves or others with nicotine so as a rule I don`t visit cinemas . But it`s a rule I broke in order to see THE TWO TOWERS because I was literally dying to see it . So I booked my ticket well in advance for the premier screening in Rothesay on the 26th of January  popped into the cinema that night and demanded to be entertained****** SPOILERS ******I was entertained and more  but I later had some reservations . On a technical level TTT not only does not disappoint but it outdoes FELLOWSHIP in terms of both scope and scale but this doesn`t automatically make it as some people have claimed a better film . The battles of Helms Deep and Isengard are truly breath taking and out do anything Hollywood has done  but ironically by concentrating on spectacle TTT feels more like a Hollywood film than FELLOWSHIP . And all this spectacle causes a problem for Peter Jackson - How does he finish all these impossibly epic set pieces ? The simple answer is he can`t ! As several reviewers have mentioned the fractured storyline comes to the rescue of the director in much the same way as Gandalf rides to the rescue of Helms Deep : Cut to the most breath taking calvary charge in the history of cinema  cut to the Ents attacking Isengard and then cut back to Helms Deep where our heroes have snatched victory from the jaws of defeat  except they did so mainly off screen . It`s as if the director has used the fractured storyline in order to get himself out of a corner . Likewise reviewers on this site have noticed the story telling technique hides several plot holes involving characters appearing and disappearing to and from the story .Of course you don`t notice these flaws at the time due to the awesome onscreen visuals but there is one major criticism you can level at TTT as soon as the credits roll and that`s a lack of an emotional impact . Yes you`ll gasp and cheer and feel your heart race but you won`t burst into tears . Remember the scenes in the first film where the fellowship escape into the mountains after Gandalf has confronted the Balrog or the departure of Boromir ? Remember how your throat tightened and you nearly had a tear run down your face ? Of course you do because these two scenes are amongst the most moving and heart wrenching in cinema history . Unfortunately there is no similar equivalent in TTT . And the film also cries out for a flawed but noble ambigous anti hero like Boromir in a story where everyone is either good or evil and no in between  though this is almost certainly the fault of Tolkien rather than Jackson who does manage to get the best out of his cast in film lacking in character development . Special mention goes to Andy Serkis who alas seems to have missed out on nominations for best supporting actor  Brad Dourif who plays a very slimy villain  and Bernard Hill who made me forget that this is the same actor who played Yosser Hughes in BOYS FROM THE BLACKSTUFF 20 years ago . But I couldn`t help but miss Sean Bean and I suppose casting him as Faramir twin brother of Boromir would have been just too obviousBut despite my criticisms I enjoyed TTT immensely and for three magical hours I forgot all about my nicotine addiction and the world outside . No doubt the audience at the Rothesay cinema felt the same way as me as we watched this film in a hushed silence . We laughed at the right bits  gasped at the technical achievements  but no one cried which means I can only award THE TWO TOWERS 9 out of 10,27 January 2003
Jackson remains a genius and this series remains a masterpiece--Faithful enough to Tolkein and a fantastic movie!,"I've read ---with care and delight--- the books four times in the last 34 years including the recent reversion to Tolkein's ""original"" manuscript edited by his son. I'm a fan. There I said it and I'm glad I tell you!This second installment of the trilogy is probably as good as a movie could get. It captures the Tolkein vibe probably as well as it could be captured in a theatrical release. Watching the flick tonight I realized that much of the vaunted charm of the very readable and very ""literary"" Tolkein books is in part the time it takes to read the long pages--- 1000 to 1400 pages depending on the edition your are holding. And that time--- weeks and weeks of pouring over pages re-reading certain passages pondering and mulling over the fake languages and songs and histories Tolkein concocted--- allows one to create and invent the Tolkein world inside oneself. That's GREAT! I loved each time I read the original. But no one could possibly expect a movie to give you in 2-1/2 hours that kind of luxurious lingering in the fantasy world. Duh!Therefore the movie's focus on action--- and FYI it is dead-on accurate and faithful to the books--- is OK. The Ents' meeting in the forest took 3 or 4 DAYS in the book and Merry and Pippin spent many more days hanging with Treebeard. The movie telescoped that down into a few hours. But hey!!! Think about it--- how could a movie ANY movie capture all of the sylvan reverie (including the Hobbits growing a couple of feet taller with the Entwash etc.) in a trilogy movie series? All of that dreamy book-world stuff would be great to see on the screen--- but it would take dozens and dozens of hours of screen-time. Who could sit in a theater for that many weeks? There aren't that many ""festive"" people on the planet to make such a theatrical release profitable.Maybe if we were wishing we could have wished for a 30 or 40 hour TV mini-series. Then we COULD afford to meander and linger and all of that. Seriously--- I'd have enjoyed it. But then the battles and evil empire and such would have to be portrayed with a vigor equal to Jackson's efforts else the drama and peril (etc.) would be lost. For MY ridiculous wishing then I'm wishing for them to have made two projects--- the 3 theater-release movies AND a 30-hour TV mini-series for all the ""literary"" vibe. But then instead of a $300 million triology we'd have had a $1 BILLION dollar (but memorable!) TV mini-series. Oh well--- if wishing were having...Overall ""LOTR Two Towers"" is an excellent movie! A ""10"" out of ""10""!!!",18 December 2002
Hail The Heroes!,"Every great adventure story worth telling has a solid hero - someone who puts others before themselves and uses their talents to do their best at keeping the forces of evil at bay even if it means the loss of life and limb. At its core this movie has eight such heroes and each one lives up to the call. From Pippin and Merry the lost hobbits who aid the Ents in battle to Gandalf Aragorn Gimli and Legolas who held back the hordes at Helms Deep to Frodo and Samwise who continue to make their dangerous and arduous trek to Mount Doom. All of these characters are heroes and they're played with love respect and meaning.Though the acting in this film was top notch throughout I found myself amazed by Gollum's (motion captured body and voice by Andy Serkis) overall performance. Though obviously CGI there was so much emotion in this character that I couldn't help believe he was real! Though ""Final Fantasy"" was the only movie that created the most realistic CGI characters that dominated an entire film Gollum is lightyears ahead with the simple fact that this deformed li'l hobbit seemed human. He had the spark of life behind those eyes that the FF ""cast"" lacked.As a film this movie has it all - action drama comedy - but none of it would've worked without characters we cared about villains we despised and heroes we cheered for. With the obvious success of the first two installments the release of the final film next December may prove this to be THE BEST trilogy ever made!",18 December 2002
Tough to put on film but came out very well,"Long before it came out I knew The Two Towers would be the toughest of the three Lord of the Rings books to put on film. Not only is it the middle child but the very structure of the book makes it hard to craft a linear story with all the plot lines in tact and interesting.But I think Peter Jackson and company did a very good job. It's not as strong as Fellowship but is still outstanding.All the elements of the LOTR films are here: the beautiful photography set designs costumes scenery special effects. All amazing all brilliant all Oscar-worthy.The performances are terrific too. Bernard Hill Viggo Mortensen Elijah Wood Miranda Otto all did great jobs. The supporting actors too.It is sad that Ian McKellan's role is relegated to almost cameo status but that's the nature of the book. The biggest shame is Christopher Lee. He has so little screen time in this film I think he only says two or three lines on camera the rest is ""brooding"". Such a waste he is one of the great actors of our time a real joy to watch (and a scene stealer to boot).But the stars of the piece have to be Gollum and Treebeard and the Uruk army. The sequence with the Ents seeing the destruction Saruman wrought upon the trees brought tears to my eyes and their revenge brought cheers to my voice. The battle of Helm's Deep was probably too long but impressive nonetheless (and will probably be the model for ""epic battle sequences"" for years to come). And Gollum. What can be said about Gollum that hasn't already been said. We have entered into a new age of CGI and like all great works of art it has a human soul.A great film. 9 out of 10 the only items keeping it from getting a 10 are the short-shrifting of Christopher Lee and that some parts don't quite flow too well (a problem rooted in JRR Tolkien's novel not the fault of the filmmakers).",5 August 2004
Fantasy greatness with one of the best sieges put on film,Well I'll be darned if this isn't one of the best epic movies I've ever seen in my life. And am ever likely TO see in my life. Following in the footsteps of THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING Peter Jackson's second instalment of the trilogy ups the ante tenfold offering one amazing movie packed with heart action romance dazzling effects and brilliant characters. Thankfully free of the time-consuming introduction needed to begin the first part of Tolkien's trilogy Jackson now has time to focus on developing characters perilous quests and of course out-and-out action. I'm an action lover at heart so I was in seventh heaven watching this movie. Everything you could want from the second book is here up on screen and even more amazing than Tolkien could render. Plus Jackson has done his magic and inserted a few memorable scenes of his own so there are plenty of surprises even for those who know whats coming.Where to begin with such a film? The characters I guess. Jackson takes the option of cross-cutting repeatedly between the three different sets of principal characters and his method pays off nicely offering a well-rounded film that never lets up with the drama (I was astonished that three hours had passed by the time this was over – it felt more like just one hour). Merry and Pippin's encounter with the Ents is awe-inspiring stuff. Of course a walking tree is a hard thing to portray but with the aid of some outstanding special effects Jackson does it and does it so superbly. Then we have Frodo and Sam crossing the dead marshes (complete with creepy corpse ghosts – the horror imagery is strong in this movie folks and Jackson doesn't skimp on the splatter either) and meeting up with totally CGI-created Gollum. Gollum is fantastic a breath of life straight from the book; Andy Serkis does wonders with his voice and movements and helps to craft the flawed schizophrenic psychology of the ugly but hugely sympathetic creature.The main action of course comes from the whole Aragorn/Legolas/Gimli storyline mixing in plenty of incident and nasty creatures along the way. The bear-like Whargs are violent and unpleasant; the Oliphants are amusing and breathtaking in equal measure; the Nazgul and their winged demons are fantastic to behold. Visually the film is always spectacular splendid and sweeping; it makes even better use of the varied New Zealand countryside than the last film which is no mean feat. Howard Shore's sweeping score is better than before and highlights the evocative nature of the movie often threatening to overwhelm us with the sheer wonder of it all. This IS Tolkien.Of course the movie finishes off with the battle of Helm's Deep a forty-minute non-stop barrage of carnage and destruction explosions mayhem and might. It's easily one of the best battles ever put on film and the special effects are entirely convincing (as they are throughout). I'll confess that I was close to tears at a couple of points – the white light streaming onto the battlefield the breaking of the dam at Isengard – these flawless moments just choked me up and made me glad to be able to appreciate the true wonder of cinema. The cast is flawless – exemplary performances from the recurring cast members kudos to newcomers Brad Dourif Miranda Otto and Karl Urban and especial mention to Bernard Hill. Nothing more can be said. A modern classic I'm only too privileged to have seen on its opening night.,19 August 2016
The Sequel That Dwarfs Its Predecessor...,"The Lord of the Rings - The Fellowship of the Ring was a fantastic start to Tolkien's epic tale. The only true weakness of The Two Towers -- if you can call it a flaw -- is that the film is the middle-child in that it has no beginning and no end. Though it starts out where the first ended The Two Towers begins with a recap of Gandalf's battle with the Balrog as we continue to see their fight as they plummet thousands (if not miles) of feet through gaping chasms in the Mines of Moria.The acting is just as great as the first and with the addition of new characters the film's atmosphere has gone from ""new and wondrous"" to ""grim and hopeless"". Needless to say Andy Serkis as Gollum is one of the best performances of the new decade. Bernard Hill does a wonderful job as Theoden as well as Miranda Otto as Eowyn. Karl Urban is a nice choice as Eomer nephew of the king. Possibly the best of the new characters is Faramir played by David Wenham. Unlike the passive-type as portrayed in the books this Faramir is more troubled and only corruptible by the Ring because of his desire to be accepted by his close-minded father -- a nice change made by the writers. The character Treebeard is a reflection of the greatness of the CG work on Gollum; both are exquisite.The writing and directing equals The Fellowship of the Ring in that the continuity remains never feeling like we missed any key moments in the plot. The only real flaw which is mainly due to pacing and events leading up to The Return of the King is the vast expansion of Frodo and Sam's journey to Mordor aided by the insidious Gollum. The changes and omissions were once again necessary to provide a decent pace and focus on the ever-rising tension of what all leads up to: the battle at Helm's Deep. Yet with the massive battle near the final 30-40 minutes of the film there's plenty more to keep a viewer attached to the screen.Fully seeing the MASSIVE software at work the special effects incorporated with the miniatures/bigatures still dazzle the eyes in flawless execution as 10000 Uruk-hai soldiers lay siege to a seemingly impenetrable fortress. From the Mumakil (elephants) to the Fell Beasts upon which the Ringwraiths ride we are given the introduction of creatures that play major roles in the following film.Howard Shore's evolution with the leitmotifs he created from the first film have now been shifted towards a more explosive composition. Equaling The Fellowship of the Ring the music for The Two Towers is nothing short of awe-inspiring. From the theme of Rohan to the thundering might of Isengard The Two Towers is full of rousing composition. There's also beautiful moments between Aragorn and Arwen as well as some wonderful choral work for the last march of the Ents.Overall while different from the text in terms of time-line The Two Towers is an extraordinary sequel to a ""trilogy"" destined for greatness. While the film ends before the events in Shelob's tunnel there's no doubt one will be amazed in what is to come. One must see this film.",26 August 2008
The Best of 2002!!!! Another masterpiece to the Lord of the Rings trilogy!!!,The Two Towers is another masterpiece of returning after Fellowship of the Ring. This had excellent and brilliant action. Like the Helm's Deep battle which made the 100 best battles of all-time. There wasn't much of a story but who cares it's Lord of the Rings!!! I loved the sword-fighting and the orcs too. This movie gave me chills down my back from the fighting and the unforgettable lines. Gollum was so cool and funny. Andy Serkis did so well in doing Gollum's voice and the CGI was amazing! The landscape once again was superb. This is another one of my favorite movies. It's not better than the fellowship and Return of the King but was very close and is still a smoking brilliant film. Go LORD OF THE RINGS BABY!!!!!!!!!10/10!!! Highly Recommend!!! You better go see this movie!!,27 April 2004
The Definition of Epic!,The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is a ripping roaring success. It's in the company of Great sequels that manage to match the original film in nearly every way. it doesn't quite have the narrative focus the Fellowship of the Ring has but it more than matches it in overall quality. The Film delves much deeper into the Lore of Middle Earth than the original film and adds a host of welcome additions to the awesome roster of characters. In short it's pretty much everything you can ever want and more.As reward for the abrupt ending of the original film The Two Towers picks up right where the Fellowship of the Ring left off. Our heroes are divided and the narrative continuously switches back and forth between multiple storylines occurring simultaneously. For starters we have Frodo and Sam on the most important quest. The Ring bearer must still journey to Mordor and cast The Ring into the fiery pit of Mount doom but they are accompanied by a new companion. The creature Gollum acts as a guide for the two Hobbits and imparts his knowledge of The Dark Lord's minions. He is a vital part of the puzzle but one with a nefarious purpose and an unhealthy obsession with the Ring one that will lead to his downfall.The Other primary story follows the remaining members of the Fellowship as they respond to the evil that has come to the great Kingdom of Rohan. We follow Aragorn Legolas and Gimli as they grow closer to one another and their friendship tightens. It's not long until they are joined by a revived Gandalf who rides to the aid of King Théoden of Rohan. It is here where the subtitle of the movie is established. The Two Towers refers to the union and alliance between Sauron and Saruman. Between the evil forces of Mordor and Isengard. Saruman sends a Seemingly unstoppable army of ten thousand against The army of Rohan and the suspense builds keeping the audiences glued to their seats until we arrive at the Battle for Helms Deep at the last half hour of the film one of the greatest War sequences in the history of cinema by far! Overall this is an Excellent movie that's almost neck and neck with the first film. The cast is once again perfect and the new additions to the roster are seamlessly interwoven in the narrative. Bernard Hill is nothing short of sublime as King Théoden. The scene when he breaks into pieces and cries over his son's death should have gotten him an Oscar Nom alone! A riveting performances! Miranda Otto is also rather stellar as The King's niece Eowyn and the affection and almost child like crush that she develops for Aragorn is very believable tender and a sharp rival to the rich chemistry He has for lady Arwen who makes a brief return as well. Andy Serkis as Gollum was a scene stealer and most definitely was robbed of an Oscar as well. Absolutely love his character Brilliant Naïve and impulsive to a fault this character has more dimension than what you can shake your staff at. He's learned and has an almost unlimited supply of knowledge though his mind is scrambled and poisoned by the ring he's tender at times vicious and duplicitous during others playful and humorous yet frightening. Sinister and hideous while also being sympathetic. What Peter Jackson and company have achieved with this character is nothing short of remarkable. He is the perfect Anti Hero for a time and is only more believable as a full on 3D Villain by the reveal at the tail end of the film. There is nothing I can truly say to you that really does this character justice.This film is as relevant today as it was when it was released. Some of the most important lessons and themes about our world are discussed here. From the nature of Evil addiction Greed and corruption the nature of Warfare. Hope in the face of insurmountable odds. The arc with Treebeard and the Ents is Great as well and is a poignant metaphor for nature vs industry. The scene when The Ents along with the brave Hobbits Merry and Pippin overtake Saruman's fortress is Inspiring as is the ending with Gandalf Eomer and the Return of the Rohirram saving Aragorn and ending the battle for Helms deep at the last minute. Sam's final Speech to Frodo about the good of this world being something worth fighting for ties all of the threads of the story in a neat little bow as does his proclaimation that their story may be one of the great stories that people will tell their children in years past. All in all The Two Towers is an instant classic and one that will leave audiences eager for the final chapter of this legendary trilogy,18 June 2019
The Two Towers! What Is It? The Answer Is: My Precious!,The second part of The Lord of the Rings saga maintains the style momentum and integrity that made the first film as brilliant as it is and thus what Peter Jackson gives us is one of the best sequels ever and certainly the best film of 2002. I prefer the first film for being closer to the book but I completely understand the changes made from book to film and I see why they are necessary to keep the film's narrative flowing instead of dropping dead. The film is not without a few weaknesses mainly because of it being a middle part linking The Fellowship of the Ring and The Return of the King and therefore not having an obvious beginning or an end. This doesn't stop the film from being an experience that people shouldn't be cheated out of.The acting is like in the first film very good and at times even brilliant. Viggo Mortensen improves greatly and provides a more well rounded and believable Aragorn and proves his qualities as an actor especially in the quit moments (of which there are too few in the theatrical release this was remedied in the extended cut). Also Elijah Wood deepens his character considerably and shows many of the darker sides of his character in the film. This provides for some interesting exchanges between Wood and his faithful companion played by Sean Astin. Bernard Hill is introduced in this film along with the method actor Brad Dourif. Both of the aforementioned are excellent in their respective parts even though there are some inconsistencies in Hill's character compared to the character from the book. These changes were obviously made for dramatic purposes and are very plausible. Ian McKellen's character Gandalf has been somewhat reduced in the second film but instead he steals every scene he is in. Likewise Hugo Weaving's character has been reduced but he is still very good and keeps his character in the same style as in the first film. Orlando Bloom and John Rhys-Davies returns as well and I have to comment on the choice to make Gimli into comic relief because while I understand the necessity given that Dominic Monaghan's and Billy Boyd's characters have taken a turn towards more serious characters there had to be someone to relieve the dramatic tension I found it a shame that Gimli had been reduced to some bumbling clown. Fortunately most of his comic remarks worked. Among other characters introduced are Faramir played by David Wenham and Gollum played beautifully by Andy Serkis. I'll get back to Faramir but for now I have to comment on Gollum. Gollum is quite simply the most interesting film character in the last decade and this relates both to the ground breaking special effects but also Serkis' performance which was most unfairly not deemed fit for an Oscar nomination. Overall the acting is excellent like in the first film and all actors manages to develop their characters in ways that are at the very least acceptable.The effects and fight scenes in this second film are among the best ever and is perhaps only bested by some of the effects in the third film in the series. The Gollum character and the battle for Helm's Deep seem to be excellent examples. Gollum is quite simply the most stunning and beautifully created CGI character of all time and he displays extraordinary emotional range. As previously stated The Battle for Helm's Deep is among the finest battle scenes ever created. Well paced and choreographed and above all the editing in between the hectic battle sequences and scared citizens provides for some emotional depth as well (something that was sorely needed in the battle sequences in Star Wars: Episode II). This gigantic battle isn't the only battle in the film. There are many other interesting battles but I'm not going to spoil them so you'll just have to see the film yourself. The battles are consistent with the style that was laid down in the first film they are simply on a much more epic scale.Some people have raved that the changes made from book to film were too radical but I completely understand and condone the reasons which were obviously dramatic purposes. Especially David Wenham's character has been criticized and after watching it the first time I was a bit unhappy with his character as well but when you think about it the changes in the character were at the very least essential to maintain the narrative structure. There are other examples but it would really be pointless to mention them because the reason is exactly the same as in the case of David Wenham's character. Dramatic purposes.Overall The Two Towers serves as an excellent link between the Fellowship of the Ring and The Return of the King and it deserves every bit of praise coming to it. One of the very best films of all time.10/10 - On my top 10 of best films,13 June 2006
A film that has a lot to tell and is a key part of the plot which will conclude in Return of the King,A year after the release of The Fellowship of the Ring all moviegoers were more than eager to continue the first masterpiece of the XXI century. The Two Towers comes with the huge responsibility of maintaining the fascination left by the first movie introduce more characters and various others having to be even grander. And he does this goal perfectly. Battles unthinkable many new important events happening new characters emerge and even better effects finalized and dramas more pronounced are just some of what The Two Towers has to offer. In The Two Towers the journey continues to seek the destruction of the One Ring. Since the outline of the scripts Peter Jackson knew that adjustments would be interconnected but would own souls. The Two Towers is not exactly a sequel but the second chapter in the saga of the ring. The main difference we noticed right away when compared to the Company is the tone of the narrative. The first contained dark environments of Middle-earth but was predominantly magical charming and fantastic weather. This is due to a specific reason: it was necessary to introduce the spectator races of beings that inhabit the world created by Tokien being required to show their worlds that have nothing to dark as the Shire and Rivendell. From gloomy just quick passage in the Prancing Pony inn and of course the long sequences in the mines of Moira. However the story is not as dark and the main concern is to tell the origin of the ring to make clear the importance of its destruction and setting the villains and heroes in the public mind especially the uninitiated in the original work. Unlike the first in which all of the Company are together and will slowly separating in The Two Towers director Peter Jackson wisely alternates between the three parallel stories in completely opposite places in the geography of Middle-earth. Still changes of pace and scenery are beneficial contributing to the advancement of events. Amid the three stories we enjoying new characters scenarios filled with visually stunning scenes. The movie starts directly in chapter two of the book since the first chapter of The Two Towers became the last of The Fellowship of the Ring to the first end with a climax better resolved in the script. Aragorn Gimli and Legolas go after the hobbits Merry and Pippin who had been captured by orcs and is meeting with Éomer the Third Marshal of Rohan and nephew of Theoden King of Rohan. Eomer gives them horses and says that a group of Rohirrim had attacked and destroyed that group of Orcs two days before and had not found any hobbit among them.Certainly this second chapter is less detailed and faithful in The Fellowship of the Ring. The main changes are in the final stages of the book but the criticisms lose some strength as some missing parts were filmed but inserted in the next movie. In The Two Towers despite the good progress the issue to join in an interesting three parallel stories (Merry and Pippin with the Ents Aragorn Legolas Gimli and Gandalf in Rohan; Frodo Sam and Gollum toward Mordor). Some important parts of the book are missing for insertion into The Return of the King For the sake of pace high duration and other factors these choices director Peter Jackson and editor Michael Horton are fully justifiable. Peter Jackson performs over exuberant work. The battle scenes are epic and a pleasure for the eyes. The director uses open shots to show the scale of the epic battle at Helm's Deep but gives close ups and shows creative camera movements to further enhance the scenes. The momentum built from preparing for battle works fine. It is noticeable tension hopelessness in the eyes of citizens not warriors mostly women and children. A desperate struggle for life chances seemingly against thousands of enemies which is modified until the arrival of Gandalf and its reinforcement of troops. The scene of Gandalf leading warriors gorge below toward the enemy carried out with slow motion is one of the most dazzling film of recent times. The talented director can be seen also at the bottom where the Ents help fight the orcs of Isengard Srauman in so as the scene of the Marshes and developing the relationship of Sam Frodo and Gollum.The Two Towers fortunately surpasses the legend that the sequence never surpasses the original staying here at the same level. The film appealed to critics and audiences grossing over $ 920 million worldwide with $ 341 million in the U.S. alone. Some complained that The Fellowship of the Ring had no end but Jackson was right to leave Boromir's death to the end increasing the emotional side. It would be very strange a year later the opening scene is the death that hung from the previous film. At the same time Jackson gives interim order in this second part knowing leave everything open for the grand conclusion of the saga in the next chapter. The Two Towers is one of the great films with content and technical working together perfectly and it serves not only to prepare for the final chapter of the series. It is a film that has a lot to tell and is a key part of the plot which will conclude in Return of the King.,11 March 2015

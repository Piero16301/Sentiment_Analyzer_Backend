"""Every man dies not every man really lives.""",The Academy Award winning war epic Braveheart is an extraordinary film that set a new bar for the genre. The story follows a Scottish peasant named William Wallace who's pushed into leading a rebellion against the tyranny of English rule when his wife is murdered. Starring Mel Gibson Patrick McGoohan Sophie Marceau and Brendan Gleeson the film has a strong cast that delivers outstanding performances. Additionally the battle sequences are remarkably gritty and violent which adds to the authentic tone of the film. And composer James Horner provides a sweeping and majestic score that's incredibly powerful. A groundbreaking film Braveheart does an exceptional job at depicting both the valor and the horror of war.,24 February 2020
It's a Masterpiece. Best Movie of All Time,Braveheart is the best movie ever made in history an absolute sculpted work of art that depicts every emotion of human existence from suffering to courage to love in front of the background of political astuteness and socio-hierarchal analysis.Telling the quasi-true story of one man's conviction and courage to exact vengeance for the killing of his first wife and father at the hands of the ruthless King Edward the II of England who in turn inspires his small province of Scotland to rebel and go to war in a real fight for freedom and independence Braveheart is a stunning depiction of the capacity of the human spirit to overcome the odds defy tyranny and achieve justice respect and dignity against oppression.Although its retractors and critics will dwell and harp on the historical accuracy of some of the movie particularly what part Robert the Bruce played in real life there is no denying the true power and emotional influence of this movie. It's understandable particularly for Europeans how this could be problematic due to their upbringing in studying history but the movie is not really about being historically perfect; it's a work of art about things much deeper. A documentary it is not and it's duplistic and hypocritical for the film's haters to dwell on this minor detail but perhaps allow historical rewriting to slide and give it a free pass in something like Tarantino's Inglourious Basterds or Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.On this topic one of the dozens of best parts in the movie is when Robert the Bruce plays an important role in one of the battles and eventually the movie does come around and get Robert's history back on track with more accuracy as to his part and character in the battle for Scotland's independence.Without trying to get the history perfect this movie is simply flawless. It's beyond flawless really. A flawless movie can just be a technical masterpiece with very little power but the raw power and emotion coming off the screen in practically every single scene in Braveheart is like an inferno.James Horner's score is one of the greatest scores ever for any movie and it successfully enhances the drama and emotion of each scene without coming across as manipulative. It fits perfectly into every single scene it is used.There isn't one acting role that is not well-done. This is one of Gibson's best acting roles and the guy who plays Edward II gives an outstanding performance.This is the greatest epic movie ever created in the history of Hollywood. A few years later another great modern epic Gladiator came out and drew rightful comparisons to Braveheart but while Gladiator is a very good movie it lacks in the emotional depth power and ultimate inspiration behind the experience of watching Braveheart.The final Act of Braveheart is one of the most powerful ever put on film. As a first time viewer you really have no idea where the story is going to go (even as a repeat viewer it still holds weight). To this day there is still nothing like it. Just when you think it's over or you know how it will end it just continues to twist and turn and then it closes with what is probably the best ending of any movie in history.In addition to all of this the body of Braveheart is loaded with outstanding battle scenes incredible editing and great dialogue rooted in inspiration political strategy philosophy and stunning human experience of love desire passion suffering and identity.When you look at the top rated movies on IMDB it is laughable that comic book movies and good popcorn-fun movies are actually rated above this. This is without a doubt hands down one of the top 25 movies ever made and in my opinion it is the #1 best movie of all-time.This movie is a masterpiece.,4 August 2019
Your Heart is Free Have the Courage to Follow It...,A simple message but even today over seven hundred years later there are far too many captive to their cultures governments and institutions. They take a large slice sometimes all of the freedoms William Wallace and so many others fought for. Keep up the fight because like the tide those oppressive forces wont curtail.A rousing piece of cinema you can forgive the historical inaccuracies in order for it to tell a hugely engaging and inspirational story full of hope although it leaves you under no illusion of mans inhumanity to man and the vile and despicable things that can be done in the name of greed power and control.,6 September 2020
One of the best modern movies of time,"I'm talking just in the 90's. The 90's were a great time for the movies we had so many memorable one's and there is no doubt that ""Braveheart"" is one of them. ""Braveheart"" is one of my favorite movies that never gets old. Despite it's long running time I will watch this movie any day.Mel Gibson has come so far in the movie business and he not only stars but directed Braveheart. He did a terrific job and deserves a lot of credit for this remarkable film. Despite it not being totally accurate with history anyone can enjoy ""Braveheart"". Based on the life story of William Wallace a town peasant who just wants to live in peace and harmony with a wife and children. But when the British king of England Longshanks is sick of Scotland ""being full of Scots"" he comes up with a way of bringing them more into a British land by ""breeding them out"". Promising any British soldier to a Scotish bride on her wedding night before her husband can have her. Wallace won't hear of it and marries his love in secret. When a British soldier notices his wife and attempts to rape her Wallace comes in and saves her causing a riot in their village and he thinks he's got her safe when he sends her away from the soldiers but they catch her and kill her right in front of her family.Wallace has had it and wants war for not only the murder of his wife and love he wants freedom for Scotland and will shed blood to do it. ""What will you do without freedom?!"" this is one of the most memorable speeches of all cinematic history during their first major battle with the British. Through countless battles friends traitors and bloodshed all Wallace just wishes for is freedom. As Robert the Bruce says to his father ""They look at him and fight by his side."" He describes Wallace's bravery and what everyone feels in wanting to be him. I love Robert's last line ""You have bled with Wallace! Now bleed with me!"" and the army stands and continues their struggling battles for freedom! This is such an inspirational movie with a powerful message ""Every man dies but not every man really lives"" to a tearful ending that will make anyone shed a tear to a terrific heartfelt sound track it's no wonder this won best picture with other Oscars. This is a movie a terrific one that everyone should enjoy and watch.10/10",21 April 2002
Freeeeeedooooommm....,It doesn't get any better than this. Mel Gibson didn't just star in this movie but directed and produced. No one will ever forget...Run and you'll live... at least a while. And dying in your beds many years from now would you be willin' to trade ALL the days from this day to that for one chance just one chance to come back here and tell our enemies that they may take our lives but they'll never take... OUR FREEDOM!,12 March 2021
A Very Fast 3 hrs,What to say about Braveheart?This movie holds up against the challenge of aging its exciting adventurous funny and passionate. The movie is beautifully shot and sounds incredible.Is it violent? Sure but what war isn't. I think Mel makes violence as much a part of the story in all his (relevant) films. The characters struggle through great violence and the impacts that is has on them by not shying away from it we are allowed to get a small appreciation of it and them.The movie isn't OTT but delivers great action that serves the story and entertains the viewer.Its considered a classic film and so it is.,21 January 2021
You should have courage to make this movie. ‚≠ê,Most of the times Hollywood movies is sided. I don't know what you believe but sadly this movie based on the truth. Only some of the minor subjects are added to make the movie more interesting. The additions were pretty minor most of the times the main subjects is based on the truth.Doesn't matter which nation you are I think you could love this movie so much. It's actually not only about wars and battles. It has so effective Romance subject. For me the actual subject. Also the movie shows how Freedom is important.Mel Gibson did something special. I don't know is there another movie like this? I'll explain the success I like in this movie. I don't have another example that any movie with great lead actor with achieving so many things. It has James Horner's brilliant scores (that I don't know how didn't get the Academy Award) has amazing Cinematography has amazing Costumes and Makeup also has magnificent Set Decoration.I don't know how Mel Gibson managed to do all these when he's acting superbly. I know making a movie is not a personal job It's more of a team job but I'm saying Gibson directed the movie so good while acting superbly. I think that's a real special achievement.,2 March 2023
Brutal But Epic Masterpiece,"This is an emotional involving and ultimately draining film. By the time you are done you are spent. What makes this movie so intense is the passion of the main character: Scottish rebel leader William Wallace played by Mel Gibson who put his heart and soul into this performance. Add to that a powerful story great cinematography excellent action scenes and even some humor....and you have a classic film.Patrick McGoohan shines as the evil English king and Sophie Marceau Agnus McFadyen and Catherine McCormack all contribute. I'm sorry the latter had such a short role as her beauty captivated me very much. All the characters in Wallace's ""army"" are fun to watch too.For those a bit queasy with bloody violence this is not a movie for you. There are lots of gory action scenes that includes limbs being hacked off. This is not a film for the feint of heart. The only objection I have to the violence is the ending. Seeing a man tortured is not my idea of entertainment. I now fast-forward through that part but otherwise thoroughly enjoy the rest of the three-hour film an ""epic"" adventure if there ever was one.The most memorable scene in the film for me was not any of the action scenes but just the absolutely stunned look on Gibson's face when he discovers his trusted ally was anything but that. To discover that the key people in the country that you are fighting for are not backing you must have been indescribably crushing to although since this is the movies I don't know how accurate this was to the real story. Whatever the accuracy it's a great film and belongs in anyone's collection of epic-adventure masterpieces.The Blu-Ray transfer by the way is spectacular.",25 March 2006
For he had only one life to give for Scotland.,On my list of the greatest movies of all time BraveHeart ranks as number 3. It is by far one of the most epic stories ever told. Mel Gibson deserved all the credit he recieved and more. His portrayal of William Wallace one of Scotlands most mightiest warriors was spot on. The only part that lacked was the romantic affair of Princess Isabella and Wallace. It historically never happened. This movie also has other historical errors but WHO CARES!The Battle of Stirling has to be the second most graphic piece of footage ever shot next to Omaha Beach in Saving Private Ryan. I love the part where the English Commander gives the order to charge and Wallace sees this and raises his broadsword into the air and starts yelling. He charges the field with the Scots and I'll let you see the movie to see what happens next.Wallace's emotional speech at the battle of Stirling still is inspirational and I think that the REAL William Wallace would be proud of the way Mel Gibson portrayed him.My hat goes off to Mel Gibson. I hope he makes a few more movies like this one.Out of ten............10/10!,19 November 1999
"""Every man dies. Not every man really lives.""","This movie is almost two decades old now and as is often the case with blockbuster films I'm just now getting around to seeing it for the first time. My timing is kind of serendipitous too because Scotland will be voting on leaving the UK next week on September 18th 2014 as I write this. It's pretty much a toss-up on how it goes though whatever the outcome the geopolitical consequences will be felt for a long time.Mel Gibson and Kevin Costner are a couple of names who frequently find themselves involved in controversy for their projects. In recent years Gibson has been at the center of some embarrassing personal exploits but there's no denying he's had a major impact on film making with movies like ""Braveheart"" and ""The Passion of the Christ"". Both films offer an epic sweep and are cinematically dynamic. The battle scenes in ""Braveheart"" are among the most expansive and realistic as you'll see anywhere.But as with most historical films and I've learned this all too well by now what you see is not necessarily what the world got at the time. I don't think such departures from accuracy are always meant to be made for the sake of revisionism nevertheless they detract from a film's educational value. So one's approach to ""Braveheart"" probably ought to be made from the standpoint of an epic period drama with it's attendant personal stories thrown in as human interest. That's what you have here with this Best Picture winner and the award is well deserved on that score. Personally I have my doubts whether the Scots ever mooned the British at the Battle of Stirling.",13 September 2014
EPIC,Braveheart depicts the life of Wallace leading the Scots in the First War of Scottish Independence against King Edward I of England. The movie boasts of a massive cast a great characters' development beautiful locations epic battle scenes and a wonderful soundtrack. It's an exhilarating gripping touching and epic experience that you won't miss.Rating: 87.,9 April 2021
Historical war par excellence,"One of the early ""historical epics"" to set off a still-current wave of ancient adventures this is epic grand stuff spoiled only slightly by a twinge of Hollywoodian uneasiness and a little overloading of sentimentality. It isn't as bad as in something like say ROBIN HOOD: PRINCE OF THIEVES but it isn't mastered to the extent it was in GLADIATOR either. Although history is sometimes rewritten and distinctions are blurred this is a moving masterpiece with a sweeping score and splendid visuals to boot.War is hell here literally; bloody and violent with limbs flying and bodies torn asunder. Yet for a film chock full of gruesome violence and obscene torture it's remarkably good-natured focusing on the characters foremost and being successful with it. Gibson is fine in the leading role ‚Äì if a little too old ‚Äì and the supporting cast are great. The plot is complex and wide-reaching and the characterisations and script are both spot on. A perfect blend of heroic escapism and back-stabbing politics this is a modern classic of the genre and it proves Gibson's worth not as a star but as a director because his direction is exemplary.",13 December 2015
A motion picture that dares to be excessive...,Set in the late 13th century 'Braveheart' is the story of one of Scotland's greatest national heroes Sir William Wallace. leader of the Scottish resistance forces during the first years of the long ultimately successful struggle to free Scotland from English rule...Crucially charismatic in the title role Gibson plays the heroic figure and emerges as a remarkable hero with wit and romantic soul determined to rid his country of its English oppressors...Wallace's revolution was set in motion with great obstacles from his countrymen... Many Scottish nobles lent him only grudging support as most of them were more concerned with wealth and titles than the freedom of the country... In fact the Scottish leaders are in favor of revolt-or not-depending on English bribes... Wallace by comparison is a man of honor incorruptible and righteous... He was knighted and proclaimed 'guardian and high protector of Scotland' but as much as he railed against the Scottish nobles submitted to Edward I King of England he was astonished and in shock to discover the treachery of the leading Scot contender for the throne¬óRobert the Earl of Bruce¬óto whom he confided  'The people would follow you if you would only lead them.' Sophie Marceau is exquisite as the distressed princess Isabella of France who ends up falling in love with Wallace warning him out of several traps...Catherine McCormack is a stunning beauty who ignites Wallace's revolution...Patrick McGoohan is chilling brutal and vicious as the ruthless Edward I known by the nickname 'Longshanks.' This king remains simply the embodiment of evil...While Angus McFadyen moves as a nobleman torn between his conscience and political aspiration and Brendan Gleeson brings strength and humor to his role as the robust Hamish David O'Hara is very effective as the crazy Irishman who provides much of the film's comic relief from even the most tensed moments...Mel Gibson has reason to be proud of 'Braveheart.' It is a motion picture that dares to be excessive... Gibson presents passionately the most spaciously impressive battles (yet staged for films) even excessively and it is his passion and excess that make the motion picture great... The horror and futility of massed hand-to-hand combats are exciting rather repulsive... It is epic film-making at its glorious best...Gibson's 'Braveheart' focuses on the human side of Wallace a character so immense so intelligent and so passionate exploring the definitions of honor and nobility pushing us to follow the hero into his struggle against injustice and oppression...There is a great shot of the lovely mountains of Scotland covered in mist with beautiful bagpipe music... James Horner's beautiful score calls up memories of his work for 'Titanic.',28 August 2005
Masterpiece,Mel Gibson not only stars but also directs one of the greatest historical movies that have ever been made. While I'm not aware of the historical facts and what parts might be true or not the appeal of the movie is undeniable.The mix of drama action and sometimes humor is perfect. The action scenes are shot great and the intense feeling of being right there in the battlefield ensues. The movie follows through from start to finish and movie deservedly got many awards. Be it the acting the costume department or any other aspect of the film if you like action movies and/or historical movies there is absolutely no reason for you not to watch this!,21 July 2009
Historical flaws aside Braveheart is a rousing spectacle.,So it comes to pass in the year of 1995 (not a year of our lord I think) that Mel Gibson would craft the award winning epic that is Braveheart a film that is historically bent in the extreme that is directed by a man who would go on to have a less than favourable character reputation and a film that has a heavy handed approach at times. It's also as choppy as a boat ride during a tidal wave so yes Braveheart is far from flawless folks. Yet the structure the epic emotional swirls and sheer spectacle of it all marks it out as a rousing treat.It's a lavish gargantuan epic that somehow seems out of place for the year it was made perhaps the secret of the films' success is because the 90s were crying out for an epic to get us hankering back to those halcyon days of Spartacus et al. Or just maybe the film punched the buttons of the public psyche because it is a great and grand thing to see the little people rise up and kick some ass? The oppressed and the bullied strike back as it were surely that theme works for the normal human being? It's a sweeping tale that involves love loyalty honour dishonour treachery death & heroes and villains. In short it ticks all the boxes for the genre it sits in (clinical bloody battles superbly full on). Gibson is William Wallace and although he may struggle to nail the Scottish accent to fully convince at times he more than makes up for it with his verve and vigour when delivering his lines - with the Sons Of Scotland speech at Stirling a particular iconic highlight.Patrick McGoohan is pure egotistical villainy as Longshanks King Edward I and the supporting cast also do sterling work (or should that be Stirling?). Brendan Gleeson Tommy Flanagan Catherine McCormack Angus Macfadyen and the wonderful James Cosmo all add flavour to the delightful scotch broth on the screen. The score by James Horner is appropriately tight to the themes at work in the piece and the cinematography by John Toll was rightly awarded at Oscar time since he captured the essence of the film. Be it the lush rolling hills or the blood stained field in the aftermath of battle Toll's work is critically in sync with the unfolding mood of the picture.So yes damn straight flaws and all pic has the ability to lift and inspire many a discerning viewer. It does kick you at times but as it does so it also emotionally engages you from start to finish - to which the film deserves every accolade and award that it won. Because the grandiose epic had seemed long gone but Gibson and his army brought it back to the modern era and made a genre piece fit to hold it's head up high with the greats of years gone by. 10/10,6 January 2010
Wallace's courage is inspiring,This epic tale of patriotism love and conflict opens with a birds eye view which takes you through mist and air out onto an open loch with scenic mountains in the background. This is accompanied by stirring bagpipe music and shortly by the start of a narrative by Robert the Bruce.After a short introduction of a young William Wallace involving his fathers death and his first step into warrior-hood we are taken to present day England where Edward Longshank's tight rule over Scotland is getting increasingly harsh. Enter a fully grown Wallace (a rugged long-haired Gibson) who is back to start a family and a new life. He soon meets Muran a girl who he remembered from way back. He and Muran fall in love and shortly get a private nighttime marriage as a public one would result in the 'Prima Nocte' rule being enforced.Unfortunately one of the English soldiers controlling their village confronts a scared Muran and forces her into a quiet spot. William leaps to Muran's rescue and all hell ensues. The commanding officer executes Muran promptly for assault on one of the King's men as she bit him whilst defending herself. She was supposed to meet William at a secret spot after she was rescued but was knocked off the horse.William returns to the village on horseback to give himself in but he has other plans. The uprising that ensues is one of the most pulse racing and exciting fights that has ever graced the silver screen IMO. This is the spark that starts off the Scottish revolution for freedom. Soon other clans join Wallace then whole towns stand by him. He soon finds himself on the fields of Stirling for a real showdown. I thought I'd give you the first hour in a nutshell the rest of the movie revolves around Wallace Longshanks and the Queen of France as they all fight for their own cause.The battle scenes are ground breaking and upfront the senses of comradeship love patriotism and courage all take a stand throughout the film. The music adds further to the epic be it sad and haunting tunes or strong and stirring bagpipe anthems. Wallace is portrayed as a beacon of strength and power not to mention a much honoured leader. Sometimes Gibson takes his character a little too far but the title Braveheart is one that is implied to Wallace's qualities. The films dramatic and moving ending is a good finish to a superb and powerful film.,27 November 2005
Epic recreation about a notorious Scottish hero who purposes to free his country from the tyranny of Edward I,"In 14th Century Scotland when his secret bride is executed for assaulting an English soldier who tried to rape her William Wallace begins a revolt and leads Scottish warriors against the cruel English tyrant  the nasty ruler Edward I (Patrick McGoohan)the Longshanks (as he was called ""The Longshanks"" -long legs- since he was uncommonly tall for a man of the time  Edward I was at least 6 feet 2 inches) who wishes to inherit the crown of Scotland for himself  ruling Scotland with an iron fist and succeeded his effeminate homosexual son Edward II Prince Edward (he was indeed the first English prince to carry the title Prince of Wales although he did not marry Princess Isabella until 1308 after both Wallace (1305) and Edward I (1307) had died) . As William Wallace begins his long quest to make Scotland free once and for all along with the assistance of Robert the Bruce. There took place several battles such as Stirling  York (though the sacking of York was invented for the movie Wallace never got as far south as York during his invasion of northern England) and the famous Battle of Falkirk (July 22 1298) in which the English army was personally led by King Edward I who decisively defeated the Scots  the real-life King Edward I was a military genius who learned combat tactics while fighting the Mamelukes during the Eighth and Ninth Crusades . There also appears Robert the Bruce  though many Scots were offended by the film's portrayal of Robert the Bruce (Angus McFayden)  who is considered a National Hero of Scotland . This epic movie contains thrills  emotion romance  breathtaking battles and being based on historical events . However  some reviewers often cited as the least accurate historical epic of all time and more than 90% of the movie is fiction. This is the classic story about confrontation between good guys  the Scots  versus bad guys  the Sassenachs . A simplistic and pure tale with rude stereotypes and offering a stew of Hollywood clich√©s  being overlong but well played and directed by Mel Gibson . Interesting script by Randall Wallace  this screen-writer had been visiting Edinburgh in 1983 to learn about his heritage when he came across a statue of William Wallace outside Edinburgh Castle; he had never heard of the 14th-century figure who shared his name but was intrigued enough by the stories told to him about ""Scotland's greatest hero"" to research the story as much as possible. The film was heavily fictitious but Gibson claimed the changes had been made for dramatic purposes  he also admitted he had always felt he was at least a decade too old to play Wallace. Impressive production design  including thousands of extras  a majority of the actors and extras in this film were actually Irish - members of the Irish Army - although they are supposed to be Scottish or English as many as 1600 were used on a given day. The film is very crude and brutal  including bloody battles  strong tortures with disembowelment provoking brave grimace and violent scenes as when Edward I threw his son's lover out of a castle window was particularly criticized for inciting homophobia  the lover was based on Piers Gaveston who was allegedly Edward II's lover. Colorful and glamorous cinematography by John Toll  showing marvelous outdoors  including glamorous opening shots  snowy peaks  silvery lochs  dark mists and many other things . Evocative and sensitive musical score by James Horner ; despite the film being set in Scotland and based on the life of a Scottish folk hero the primary instrument heard throughout the soundtrack -most notably at William's father's funeral- are the Uilleann pipes which are a smaller traditionally Irish version of bagpipes rather than the ubiquitous Great Highland Bagpipe.This motion picture was very well directed by Mel Gibson and he picked up two Oscars for Best Film and Best Director ; though this film has been accused of promoting Anglophobia. Mel said that was influenced by various classic and historical flicks  among the films Gibson watched in order to prepare to direct ""Braveheart"" were Polanski's ""Macbeth"" ""Spartacus"" ""Chimes at Midnight"" ""Alexander Nevsky"" ""A Man for All Seasons"" ""The Lion in Winter"" ""Seven Samurai"" and ""Throne of Blood"" . Rating : Better than average. Worthwhile watching . The picture will appeal to Mel Gibson fans .",7 February 2015
Best movie ever,Most on this site pick the Godfather or the Shawshank Redemption but this is it this is the best film ever made. People will complain will argue that I am wrong but I will say it again...Braveheart is as close to perfection as a movie can be. The acting is superb the man who played Lonshanks the actor who portrayed Robert the Bruce both should have been nominated for Oscars due to their powerful rendering of evil and a man who is saved from losing his humanity (from becoming evil) by meeting William Wallace. And let us not forget the direction the cinematography. Braveheart is glorious beautiful to look at. The slow motion pictures of horses preparing to charge armed combatants the entire landscape of Scotland that Mel Gibson captures with the camera. Braveheart is artwork it is as good as any picture. That the film is number 93 on the list of the top 250 movies ever is a shame. Yes there is violence in this film but that violence does serve a point...that freedom isn't free and sometimes it takes death gruesome and horrible to let ones people taste what it is like to be free. Braveheart is a great movie and it deserves to at least be in the top ten of IMDb's list of greatest films.,13 September 2005
I'd give it more if i could,I watched it years ago and just now and will definitely watch it again.. I feel like you can't rate it it's just beyond that it's so beautiful and it's epic. One of the best movies ever made. Mel Gibson is a true legend.,27 December 2020
Rip Roaring Fun,William Wallace (Mel Gibson) is the son of a minor landowner who was killed by Longshanks' treachery. He would start a revolt after his secret wife was executed unjustly. The revolt would grow to an all out war against the tyrannical king of England.Director Mel Gibson is pulling all the stops to create this epic historical melodrama. It is rip roaring fun. The action is blood splattering joy. The scale of the battles are actually quite impressive with real people. It's the kind of sword swinging that every boy dreams of playing. The story is full of melodrama starting with avenging his great love to a romance with a princess. Historical accuracy is unnecessary when it's so much fun. It taps into all of the archetypes of heroes and villains putting them into a compelling historical drama.,8 January 2014
A flurry of emotions to move you in every direction (at least once),"Unfortunately I have yet to find a film of quite this caliber again. Braveheart contains elements of Romance (several heart- wrenching and warming instances) Epic/Action (spectacular scenes) Mystery (can take a few viewings to put it all together) History (albeit romanticised) and of course Drama (perfectly unravelled). This level of uncompromised multi-tasking allows the film to move you to laugh and cry love and hate or even to think and be taught. I'm trying to avoid the clich√©s of glowing reviews (almost as bad as entirely negative ones) - but this is one of the few movies that I feel deserves one.The witty banter between friends/foes/lovers/relatives is in my opinion flawless and aids the film's claim as a true classic. The soundtrack is similarly top-notch and encapsulates and refracts the patriotic theme during several key moments. The political sub-plot and gorgeous scenery also serve as refreshers during otherwise heavy areas of the story. Perhaps Braveheart's only flaw (but if you share my sentiments it's actually a bonus) is its length so you'll want to prepare a comfy seat and maybe even two pots of tea (complete with cosies!).I suppose it's also relevant to touch on the historic inaccuracies as I expect this is what people might dislike most about this film. However ""History is written by those who have hanged heroes""; also the overall sketchiness of such periods coupled with the right of artistic license are enough for me to personally dismiss such thoughts. On that note I hope you also enjoy what to me is the greatest film created (so far).",13 December 2004
A Majestic Film of Scotland,This enthralling movie Braveheart takes a viewer's breath away. The invigorating battle scenes the incredible acting and the fierce power of love all captivated me when I first saw this movie. James Horner's music is a masterpiece--it adds elegance and dimension to the magnificent film. Mel Gibson's zealous passion as his character William Wallace is truly an inspiration. Scots are very dignified highly revered people and this movie really presented Scotland's pride.Everything in this film was done tastefully. Even the ending which by the way is heart-wrenching was done artistically as Wallace sees his wife during such a traumatizing event. Of course nothing was better than the rich satisfaction of watching Wallace scream for freedom freedom and not mercy. This epic film must be watched again and again.,4 December 2004
Simplistic but superlative action film (spoilers),"Those who lambast Mel Gibson for his supposedly anti-Jewish sentiments in his recent production ""The Passion of the Christ"" would do well to remember his anti-English and indeed anti-gay portrayals in this otherwise superlative action film. Gibson's epic bloody romance was never meant to be a factual account of Scottish legend William Wallace but has stimulated more interest in the real thing than a mere documentary ever could.Set in Britain in the 13th Century the plot based largely on myth about the Scottish renegade sees a young William Wallace (James Robinson) witness the brutal murder of his father (Sean Lawlor) at the hands of English occupiers. He is taken under the wing of his wise Uncle Argyle (Brian Cox) and grows up under his guardianship. Wallace (now played by Mel Gibson) returns home an educated man falls in love with a beautiful local girl Murron (Catherine MacCormack) and marries her. However when English soldiers rape and murder his wife Wallace mounts a rebellion bringing him into conflict with both the English King Edward Longshanks (Patrick MacGoohan) and duplicitious Scottish nobles led by Robert the Bruce (Angus MacFayden)...The film makes no effort whatsoever in regards to historical accuracy and the the characters come off (with variable success) as simplistic stereotypes. There is nothing wrong with most of this but some stereotypes could have been avoided in particular the portrayal of King Edward's son as a snivelling homosexual fop. By necessity the English are the villains with the Scots either passionate warriors or double-dealing nobles. Whilst the anti-English sentiment is a touch overdone (a character exclaims ""Excellent!"" when he's told he'll get to kill the English) it doesn't seriously harm the film.Gibson has thankfully not Americanised his tale by asking American actors to assume fake Scottish brogues. With the exception of Gibson himself almost everyone's accent here is natural and the film is better for it. Gibson delivers his all as Wallace managing a passable Scottish accent. His Wallace is a Scottish Mad Max only savvier more sentimental and with a powerful patriotic streak. The character though lacks the ambiguity to make him a realistic personality. The film sees nothing questionable in Wallace invading England effectively lowering himself to the level of his former oppressors.As for the supporting players Patrick MacGoohan quietly evinces menace as the ruthless King and Sophie Marceau makes the most of her limited role as the Princess of Wales. Angus McFayden gives a sympathetic portrayal of a torn Robert the Bruce and Brendan Gleeson and David O'Hara provide solid backup as Wallace's trustiest allies.The battle scenes in the film are frenetically staged with lots of quick editing plus copious amounts of blood and gore. They are well put together but the endless slicing dicing and skewering becomes repetitive after a while. Woven into the tale is a gentle Celtic score by James Horner.Whilst it has stirred interest in Scottish interest and heritage (including the life of the real William Wallace) taken on its own terms ""Braveheart"" is an enjoyable action film and should not be taken any more seriously than that.",26 April 2004
Mel versus history,"Why is Braveheart regarded as a great movie? It's a serious question.I'll grant the soundtrack is fine - probably the last effective work by the now increasingly insufferable James Horner.Aside for that Braveheart belongs with Gladiator and Titanic to the Hall of Fame of ""Bafflingly popular but nothing special"" pseudo-historical movies (and I'd argue it's the weakest among those three).So why is this great? Characters? Set-pieces? The human drama is laughable. Director Mel Gibson and writer Randall Wallace never met a clich√© they didn't like. The true historical events would be interesting enough without spicing them up with nonsense; see the fictional romance between Wallace and princess Isabella something so mawkish it would make a soap-opera writer blush with shame (note that the real Isabella was about ten years old when Wallace died).Characters are painted in broad strokes: Wallace = flawless hero giving Gibson the chance to play the umpteenth messianic figure of his career; Edward Longshanks = Satan with Patrick McGoohan having a blast as the moustache-twirling villain; Isabella = romantic princess yearning for real love so lovely Marceau can make puppy eyes at Gibson and have ludicrous ""Oooh he looks so hot!"" chats with her handmaiden. The only one who is given some depth is Robert Bruce allowing Angus Macfayden to walk away with the movie. Other low points include the racism inherent in making every British character a sneering monster and the odiously homophobic portrayal of Edward II - who was just a little boy at the time - as an effete mean-spirited buffoon (think how the murder of his lover is played for laughs!). Battle scenes while featuring a certain visceral intensity are not great. There is no sense of complex tactics or spatial relationships; Gibson's notion of medieval warfare seems to be ""people running and screaming"". Incidentally swords are MELEE WEAPONS. They cannot be thrown at a great distance with a whirling sound to impale an enemy far away... unless you are in some cheap sword and sorcery flick.The funniest thing about these battles though has to be our heroic Scots using both face paint (which was a Celtic practice hundred of years BEFORE) and kilts (invented much LATER). It's the equivalent of a WWII movie with soldiers carrying both medieval armors and iPods. However while ridiculous this is a non-issue compared to clich√©s and paper-thin characters.Still this is per se a watchable flick - just don't try to sell it as the next Lawrence of Arabia. 6/10",12 September 2008
One of the best films ever made,In this spectacular historic movie a young Scotsman becomes the hero of his country after his wife gets killed by the members of the English occupying force. In the beginning of the movie young William Wallace experience the death of his father and brother. They get killed by the English Kings Soldiers. After this he grows up with his uncle. Years later Wallace (Mel Gibson) returns back to the farm of his father to fall in love Murron (Catherine McCormack) the same girl who gave him a flower after the burial of his father and brother years ago. Because the English noblemen have the right to deflower every new married girl Wallace marries Murron in secret. But the young luck won't last forlong. A few English soldiers try to rape Murron at a marketplace. Wallace tries to rescue her but the agressors can catch her and kill her right on the marketplace. When Wallace finds out about it he takes revenge. He executes the murderers of his beloved. This ation is like a wake-up call for his fellow countrymen. They see him as their Leader to defeat the English occupying power. In their first battle the highlanders accomplish to defeat a numeral superior English Force. Wallace becomes an inspiration and more and more Scottish people follow him into war. Meanwhile in England the tyrannic King Edward the Longshankes (Patrick Mc Goohan) takes notice of the triumphs of Wallace. But this is not his only problem: His and heir apparent is a mollycoddled coward who doesn't behave like his father would like to see it from a Prince. At least Edward the Longshakes arrange the marriage between his son and the lovely Princess Isabelle of France (Sophie Marceau). Besides this the Kings health is not the best anymore. But not only the English have their problems: The Scottish Landlords betray each other for more land and try to get more land for themselves from the English King. During the movie you'll see a lot of great filmed battles two heart breaking love storys (first between Wallace and Murron later in the movie young princess Isabelle falls in love with Wallace) and an exciting story about love hate patriotism deception and heroism all in front of a wonderful landscape (the movie was actually set in Ireland). When you watch this movie you'll be carried away by this powerful and always haunting epic and unterstand why there was no other chance than giving this movie 5 Oscars (including the award for the best film). It is a film who has it all: A great story perfect filmed battles one of the best soundtracks ever made (it is a shame that the score didn't win an Oscar) and a hell of a cast. The role of William Wallace fits Mel Gibson perfect: heroic romantic but always in a down to earth kind of way. Sophie Marceau and Catherine McCormack are lovely from their first appearance until the end of the film and Patrick McGoohan gives the most despicable (this is meant as a compliment) interpretation of an English King ever seen. This movie you can see over and over again and it never looses his magic and it is a movie you can watch with men and women as well: Men will love the great staged battles and women will love the lovestory.,28 February 2007

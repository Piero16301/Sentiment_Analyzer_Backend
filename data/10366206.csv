A new standard has been set for fight scenes,Half of this review will be me gushing about the action. Wow. Just wow. I was in complete awe. There were multiple times I was both tearing up and laughing at how unbelievably amazing the fight scenes are. Now this is nothing new for the John Wick series. But for me this is far and away the best action of the entire series.I'm an action junkie and am repeatedly disappointed with action movies and their terrible fight scenes filled with shaky cam quick cuts and close-up shots (looking at you Snake Eyes and Mortal Kombat). Then I watch a John Wick movie and feel so spoiled while also being baffled at why other action movies can't learn from this. The fights are so fast-paced yet completely clear and easy to follow.There is every kind of action imaginable. So many weapons styles chases vehicles animals everything. So much creativity with the kills. Amazing combinations of weaponry and fighting styles (gun/sword combo is my fave).The music is awesome as usual maybe even a step up. It enhances every action scene. The cinematography is pristine. So many beautiful shots so many mesmerizing locations for the action. It is stylistically beautiful.There are a couple of scenes that are shot in such a creative way that I've never seen before. One is an overhead shot one-take that I couldn't believe. It takes the movie to a new level. So many scenes feel like they're a video game brought to life. Numerous times it feels like the VR game Pistol Whip.Donnie Yen is awesome. End of paragraph.About an hour into this nearly 3-hour movie I felt like I experienced enough action amazingness for an entire movie. I was in a state of ecstasy. Not only was this looking like the best of the series I started wondering if this would be a landmark action flick. Maybe it's my own fault for setting expectations so high mid-movie but the second half is more flawed though still awesome.The subplot with the tracker doesn't seem at all consequential. And his dog attacks were already done and better with Halle Berry in Parabellum. A few of the issues I had with Parabellum pop up again like overdoing it sometimes with the damage he takes. For example instead of getting hit by one car he gets hit by three cars. And that's a mild example. Also it's fairly anticlimactic.Even with those flaws I had a BLAST with this movie and will definitely see it at least once more in theaters. Seeing it on a premium screen is a must. Loudest speakers biggest screen. TRUST ME.EDIT: I was itching to go again since opening night. I wasn't able to wait more than 5 days. On second viewing I still felt the same flaws but I didn't care. The action is incredible. It has at least three of my all-time favorite action scenes. I want to watch these scenes a hundred times.It's definitely not perfect but I still consider it an action landmark (last time I said that was Mad Max: Fury Road). Every other action movie should learn from this. Updating rating from 8 to 9 stars. (2 viewings opening Thursday UltraScreen 3/23/2023 UltraScreen 3/28/2023),24 March 2023
Yeah,By now you know what to expect from a John Wick movie. I thought the franchise was losing a little momentum in chapter 3 so I was worried this could be disappointing. It's not. It's even more on steroids than any Wick before! Even close to 3 hours it doesn't feel to long which is very special for a action movie. This franchise has set new standards. If anybody says a movie is good like John Wick it better f'n be! The set pieces as everyone mentioned before are really insane this time. The Tokyo sceney with illuminated cherry blossoms was beautiful. The only super illogical thing that bothered me was that nobody flinched at the nightclub eventually they did but after a whole 10 minute beatdown through the whole club but then again it's a shady nightclub for high table people. If you liked the first three movies get your ass to the cinema. Yeah.,23 March 2023
Not Just The Best John Wick But Possibly One Of The Best Action Movies Ever,Ever since the original John Wick the franchise has set a standard of what action in Hollywood should be. Thanks to Chad Stahelski and Keanu Reeve's knowledge of the technical aspects of shooting action they've been able to deliver expertly choreographed shot and edited action films that are now the go to as examples of great action filmmaking. And so the expectations for the fourth film were fairly high especially as it became more apparent this was not only the culmination of everything before it but a whopping 169 minutes long. Rest assured however that it delivers in spades. Everything we have come to know and love is here but with an infusion of creativity like we haven't seen from the franchise yet.John Wick is in a bad way as we open up. He's a man on a mission to get out from under the High Table with seemingly no end in sight. As he blazes a trail of bullets and corpses those who have helped him or crossed his path find their own lives disrupted. With all hope lost he soon finds the opportunity he's looking for when he discovers that he can put his life on the line for a chance to finally get out. The film brings with it a whole host of new characters including Donnie Yen's Caine Shamier Anderson's Tracker Hiroyuki Senada's Shimazu Rina Sawayama's (in a fantastic big screen debut) Akira Scott Adkins' Killa and of course Bill Skarsgard as new villain Marquis. It's a full cast but everyone gets a chance to shine and could easily have their own films. Donnie Yen in particular demonstrates once again that he is a legend in this industry with several great fights of his own. But of course this is Keanu's film all the way and he gets to bring everything with him in the biggest film yet.Covering four continents we get fights on a massive set of stairs fights in the middle of traffic at one of the coolest looking hotels ever shown on screen and so on. The fighting of course is exceptional and it brings nunchakus dogs throwing stars swords guns and so much more. It's everything a John Wick fan could want and because these films are so technically proficient you never feel like you're missing any of the action. Possibly the most creative choice is my favorite scene one that combines a visually fantastic weapon with a shot choice that is unusual for action films of this nature but the combination of these two pushes the scene into maybe one of action film's greatest scenes.Admittedly the story does leave a bit to be desired but the minor complaints about these kinds of things pale in comparison to what we get. Hollywood has a new film to hold itself to and I have a feeling that (at least for me) action filmmaking will be judged by the standard this movie sets. It's such a blast I already want to see it again.,17 March 2023
While the Wick franchise has already solidified itself one of the best in the action genre this massive film is the most spectacular entry of the genre in 30 years.,Stuntman turned writer/director Chad Stahelski struck gold with his 2014 surprise hit John Wick. It was somewhat of a comeback for the legendary Keanu Reeves and reinvigorated the action genre. Since then it's become THE action juggernaut franchise. Now we are on number 4 and while usually things get redone with that amount of sequels this film innovates and thrills to new heights in an absolute epic.One of the most surprising aspects of this particular entry is the story being written as well as it is. Something that is hard to come by in the genre at times. Not saying the others in the franchise weren't but this is easily the best story diving deeper in the high table aspects as well as John Wick's true emotions . The rich characterization is also at its best with outstanding additions like Skaarsgard and even more screen time for supporting greats like Fishburne to compliment the magnificent Reeves. RIP Lance Reddick. It's nice to have such substance amongst the endless high octane ballistic visuals.Speaking of ballistic this movie goes more all out than any I've seen for insanely well crafted choreographed shootout and fight scenes. Just when you thought you've seen it all Stahelski/Reeves prove their action minds are ever evolving. These guys were born to make action movies together.The extremely vibrant colors and plethora of locations is also a feast for the eyes. The sharp atmospheric imagery creates the ultimate backdrop for not only the action but also just the dialogue. The sound is also top notch and perfectly compliments the intensity. It's just an absolute sensory journey that you don't get in too many action films aside from the Wick genre.Overall the limitless and outrageous action alone is nothing like we've seen before for the genre or just cinema in general . But also this rich unique story may only build Wick's timeless character for more films in the future which at this momentum will be welcomed.,16 March 2023
The Best John Wick Sequel,John Wick: Chapter 4 picks up where Chapter 3: Parabellum left off. As has been the tradition in the sequels to this beloved martial arts action franchise the action starts from the very inception of the film's opening and lasts until the curtain falls. JW4 is no exception to that rule. What it does do is improve on the prior installment and solidify Keanu Reeves as the greatest martial arts action star of all time. If you don't accept that notion then you must accept the fact that it solidifies Reeves and Director Chad Stahelski as the greatest martial arts action pairing of modern times.The film opens in New York City the home of the notorious Continental Hotel and takes us to Osaka Japan Paris France and Berlin Germany. Each of those cities plays a major role in Reeves' quest to seek revenge against the High Table for the acts outlined in the prior films and to seek his unconditional freedom from service to their order.As the story unfolds we learn a bit more about Wick's past and upbringing than we did in the prior films but not enough to get bogged down in. He uses his connections to his past and the help of some old friends to find a path to level the playing field with the High Table's Emissary The Marquis played masterfully by Bill Skarsgård. Skarsgård makes the character memorable and unique with just a hint of Santino from the second installment.Keanu Reeves as John Wick in John Wick 4. Photo Credit: Murray Close Hiroyuki Sanada and Reeves are reunited having starred in 47 Ronin together. Sanada as is always the case is a strong presence in the film and makes the most of every scene he is in. He is a great addition to the film. The Osaka Continental fight scenes are groundbreaking and among the best and most exciting in the entire series. This is some of the best fight and action choreography you will see; only topped by other scenes in this same movie.Scott Adkins plays an unusually larger than life villain adeptly. The action and violence around the Berlin scenes involving his character and his relationship to Reeves' past is fun to watch. Adkins is great to watch whether starring in his own projects or supporting as he is here.Shamier Anderson and Clancy Brown are new to the series and add great value. Anderson as a cunning assassin conflicted between admiration and greed. Clancy Brown is a strong presence and welcome replacement in the role of Adjudicator. I found Asia Kate Dillon's version of the same character to be the weakest part of the prior film and perhaps of the whole series.Mark Zaror another great martial artist also has a prominent role as The Marquis' right hand man.Ian McShane and Laurence Fishburne return and offer more than just familiarity to the cast. Their roles are significant and meaningful.Donnie Yen brings not only his skills as one of the finest martial arts movie stars in the world but lends his presence as a charismatic and riveting figure. He plays the role of Caine with complexity and humanity that is a terrific mirror to Reeves' Wick; his friend and adversary by circumstance. This was a fantastic choice to take the Wick series to a new level.Keanu Reeves continues to be engaging empathetic and dynamic in the role of John Wick. While the series has strayed a bit from the deeply reluctant anti-hero of the first film; we continue to cheer for the good guy caught up in a bad bad world. One of the great strengths of the film is that Reeves and Stahelski are not afraid the let characters other than Wick shine. In fact all of the stars of this one have their deeply profound and memorable moments in and out of the company of the main character. This really works.As for the fight and action choreography. The stunt team at 87eleven continue to elevate the game. The film has three major larger than life action sequences that each individually outdo anything you will see in any other non John Wick movie. As mentioned previously the Osaka and Berlin scenes were high energy high body count affairs. They were complete with gun fights sword mastery gun play and one of the best nunchuck displays you will ever see outside of a Bruce Lee movie. As for the scenes in Paris at the Arc De Tripomphe and on the Church steps they are unlikely to be forgotten and unlikely to be topped for years to come if ever. They are unique and exciting and violent feasts for the eyes.While I have heard some say that John Wick: Chapter 4 is the best installment in the series I have to disagree Nothing can top the original in my opinion; however Chapter 4 is a worthy installment for sure.Will there be a Chapter 5 to the JohnWick saga? Remember I said this was a Spoiler free review....John Wick: Chapter 4 earns a 5 out of 5 star rating. It is worth seeing and probably seeing again. I predict a significant box office gross for this one and it is well deserved.,17 March 2023
How Can Anyone Choose to Watch Marvel Over This?,"Most American action flicks released these days have poor screenplays and overuse computer-generated imagery. The John Wick franchise is one of the few exceptions along with Mission Impossible. These franchises keep getting better with every entry. Hollywood can make action masterpieces but Marvel has greater demand so that's what we get most of. It's a shame.The stunts and choreography are beyond impressive. Every artist involved does their job to perfection. Donnie Yen's performance is unbelievable. Not only does he fight great but he also has to move like a blind man. Keanu Reeves is also very impressive. Keanu IS John Wick. Although there are a few scenes where his enemies stand by and wait for their turn to attack it's easy to overlook because everything else is so great.I can't fathom how anyone could choose to watch Ant-Man over John Wick. It's so fast-paced and the choreography and stunts are mesmerizing and brutal. When the action breaks out it's unbelievable. It's hard to explain -- you have to see it! Why watch a computer-generated ""superhero"" fly around when you can witness Reeves and Yen engage in a genuine and thrilling fight?",22 March 2023
It Kills!,JOHN WICK: CHAPTER 4 (2023) ***1/2 Keanu Reeves Laurence Fishburne Ian McShane Lance Reddick Clancy Brown Bill Skarsgard Donnie Yen Aimee Kwan Hiroyuki Sanada Shamier Anderson Rina Sawayama. Reeves' indestructible titular assassin returns in full form in the latest (and arguably best) of the fast-hitting brutally violent action franchise with the marker on his head increased by new foe Skarsgard (oily good at being the villain) and the countdown to his demise imminent worldwide. The set pieces are displayed with cunning skill and scary accuracy with pressure point precision and unnerving balletic grace. A *chef's kiss* for the wherewithal overall and a genre fan's wet dream fulfilled. It kills! (Dir: Chad Stahelski),24 March 2023
Hands down the best action movie franchise ever.,"Indiana jones terminator predator Jurassic park the matrix Jason bourne etc. All amazing franchises but all share a common trait of having a bad or forgettable movie or 2 at some point. This is why john wick is the best action action movie franchise of all time; The movies just keep getting better and better. In john wick 4 when the action starts in Osaka Japan it never let's up despite it's almost 3 hour running time. What I really enjoyed the most about JW4 is the cast of characters. Great villains and allies really keep this movie interesting as john trots the globe for 3 hours. The sound engineering editing direction cinematography are excellent as always. The color schemes throughout this franchise (more john wick 2 3 and especially 4) are such a treat for the eyeballs. Best action franchise EVER. And the shotgun fight in Paris with the ""dragons breath"" is the best action sequence I've probably ever seen in my life.",23 March 2023
A thrilling masterpiece worth the long run time even better in IMAX! Important to note Rip Lance Reddick he was amazing in his career!,May or may not count as a spoiler but John Wick pilled up more of a body count than Jason Vorhees sure different genre yet both great killing machines! Chad Staleski created such a great action extravaganza quad of films and one of my favorite trivia's he was the stunt doable for Keanu Reeves in the The Matrix back in the day; fast forward to 2014 they work together on one of the greatest action films of our generation. John Wick 4 is ultimate experience that is a must see I can't praise enough for how much fun it is.I might get vibes for my thoughts I tried not to spoil it's obvious the combination of kill count has added up the rest left to the viewers the action and writing is incredible for Chapter 4 that everyone involved deserves praise! I'd like to say too I own all the John Wick films and every Matrix I'll get this in 4K when available.,24 March 2023
Best,Delivers a best high octane action thriller from the franchise .Pros - There was bit let down in JW3  but they came back with a banger JW4 and delivered one of the best actions of all time . Stunt choreography  Camera work  editing and heart pumping BGMs were totally bonkers . There were many prolonged action sequences through out the movie  each of them never fails to deliver some thrill and adrenaline rush . Besides from action set pieces  JW4 well contributed in the world building and this whole tetralogy done a good job in World building & character establishments  I hope it will be well used in its upcoming spin off series and movies . Cast did great job  especially Keanu Reeves and Donie Yen were great .Cons - Few silly logical mistakes that you can't ignore .Overall  to the action lovers and John wick fans out there don't miss out to watch it on big screen . Must watch . Highly recommended .,24 March 2023
Legendary....,"We all walk into John Wick 4 with expectations of what we will see standards we refuse to lower and excitement already creeping in. From the first second it engages you no hesitation no quarter. And it's only the beginning. I read somewhere that a reviewer had said that there wasn't a wasted moment in this film and I watched it questioning the validity. They weren't wrong. Each conversation has a purpose each scene makes a point. From the gunfight samurai scene in Tokyo to the phosphorus gunfight shot from above in Paris the action doesn't diminish. Normally a sequel is ""lesser"" but John Wick 4 simply builds onto the quadrilogy. It makes sense it continues the story and the characters get all the more interesting.I can tell you right now if the phosphorus gunfight scene doesn't impress you (which it will) the Paris traffic carnage scene is brilliant. I can't say I have ever seen someone do full continuous 360 drifting in a muscle car either :DI know Keanu said that Chad Stahelski and himself were taking a long break from the John Wick series but should we have seen the end it ended on a note I feel we could live with. If they can find another story that will build onto the John Wick series then so be it but if not I truly left the movie happy and felt it was done.Don't leave until after the credits are done. Trust me it's not finished.",22 March 2023
John Wick: Chapter 4 offered me 169 minutes of pure entertainment with an exciting cast of characters and action sequences that'll impress anyone a perfect action film,"My expectations for John Wick: Chapter 4 was high these films have become some of my favorite action films of all time and I can say this without giving it a second thought how it met those expectations. The thugs and easy obstacles are nothing new except for how they too have ballistic suits like our protagonist. But this Chapter begins with a recovered Baba Yaga who's out for blood. Actors and returning characters along with Keanu Reeves as John Wick is Laurence Fishburne as the Bowery King Ian McShane as Winston Scott and Lance Reddick (in one of his final roles) as Charon. New roles which I loved was Donnie Yen as Caine: a blind High Table assassin and an old friend of John Wick.Bill Skarsgård as the Marquis Vincent de Gramont: a powerful member of the High Table whose position is challenged by John Wick. Hiroyuki Sanada as Shimazu Koji: the manager of the Osaka Continental Hotel and an old friend of John Wick. It also stars Shamier Anderson Rina Sawayama and Scott Adkins.The premise goes like this: John Wick uncovers a path to defeating The High Table. But before he can earn his freedom Wick must face off against a new enemy with powerful alliances across the globe and forces that turn old friends into foes.Let's dig deeper into the story and what sequences I liked the most I have a weak spot for samurai movies and the Osaka Continental offers just that. Brilliant choreography for each character good guys like bad guys. With Hiroyuki Sanada being as brilliant as ever! Also showing off Donnie Yen's retired blind assassin. It's always nice to see a new Continental and this one sure felt special you notice what friendship John Wick and Shimazu Koji has. The action sequence was great! But my favorite city and action sequences are found in Paris it has the biggest importance to the story it brought so many memorable moments. It shows why Keanu Reeves was and is right to lead this franchise. Paris is also the city where Marquis Vincent de Gramont is located and he becomes the highest-ranking member of The High Table during this film. Bill Skarsgård holds one of the strongest performances in the film as the Marquis. Keanu Reeves holds the best though maybe not the best dramatic performance but certainly overall performance as he does his own stunts alongside everything else and the stunts are incredible. Donnie Yen was great and possibly even one of the best things of the movie both his knowledge in martial arts but also his character which I loved. The performance that surprised me was Shamier Anderson as the mysterious bounty hunter it's a great character that they could do so much with and I can easily say the same for Donnie Yen and Hiroyuki Sanada's characters. One of the final action sequences was all in a one take except for a quick cut before moving back to the one take. It was shot with a camera above letting us see everything happening from above and moving with John Wick as he fires inside an abandoned building.Chad Stahelski truly directed an action film that'll be remembered for decades his direction in both the action and more dramatic scenes are all brilliant. There's so many fight sequences in this film small like big all directed and shot brilliantly. The screenplay was done by Shay Hatten and Michael Finch I don't have any problem with it it's good and for a Wick film it holds the same quality. The movies aren't about the best writing in Hollywood it's about what happens on the screen blood being spilled. Tyler Bates and Joel J. Richard returned to compose the score for the film after doing so for the previous three films. Like Shay Hatten had done too.I have read various of critics and some people complaining about the length Chapter 4 has a runtime of 169-minutes. Its long full of beautiful looking shots that does nothing to the story only to create atmosphere and suspense where it succeeds. There are scenes that you could easily trim yes but I still found the length to be perfect. I want to see the 3 hour 49 minute version just because of how great the film was but the theatrical version is magnificent. Chapter 4 is all about tying up loose ends to finally find peace and freedom. It's a long road to that point Chad uses the film's length for just that to tell a bigger and deeper story than a simple story. More run time also means for more action sequences!This might be the best film of the four both action and drama also most beautiful in regards of the camera work and cinematography. Dan Laustsen truly knows his craft making each scene absolutely mesmerizing to look at! I loved every second of it when I saw it at the cinema a woman (a mother) sat beside the person I was there with and said how brutal it was... She was five minutes in and the first action scene had only just started. Jokes aside John Wick: Chapter 4 has some of the franchise's best action sequences and Keanu Reeves at his best. Like his role in The Matrix John ""Baba Yaga"" Wick will be another role he'll be remembered for. This was an incredible film one of the best I've seen in awhile.",26 March 2023
Adrenaline rush,Quite possibly the best action movie of the decade. It's only 2023. This one is currently number one. Terminator 2 is the best action movie of all time. The raid 2 is the best action sequel of all time. This movie is the best 4th movie in a series of all time. Props to lethal weapon 4 as well. Keanu is a bad ass ok. He moves a little slow in the beginning but by the time the second half comes along he moves like a martial arts madman. That being said.. the nunchucks he incorporates into his character in that first half is brilliant. The set pieces in this are absolutely fantastic. The music is perfectly incorporated as well. There were a few nods to some classic flicks too. Movie buffs will catch them.,24 March 2023
THIS is how you justify a 3 hour runtime,In a world where movie sequels seem to be loathed even before they are released the 'John Wick' series has remained remarkably consistent and well received. In fact all three of the first films have the same IMDb rating of 7.4/10 and I noticed recently that I gave them all the same rating of 8/10. Incredibly I think 'John Wick: Chapter 4' is the best the series has to offer. This movie was a wild ride.I was a little disappointed when I first saw the runtime for this one was going to be almost 3 hours. I find that is becoming a tough runtime for a lot of films to justify. This film does it with no trouble. The pacing is so incredibly fast that the 3 hours pass by in no time. I remember looking down at my watch early in the film thinking maybe 20-25 minutes had gone by and almost an hour had already passed.A large reason for this is the action sequences. When an action sequence starts in this film buckle in because it is going to go for nearly 20-30 minutes and be non-stop craziness the for the duration.The action sequences in this film are perfectly shot as they always are in this series. Lovely wide camera angles so we can see every thing that happens and know that it isn't all being edited to look this way. These people are actually doing these things.As always with these films you need to go in a rather incredible suspension of belief. Wick is nearing super-human level at this point. It doesn't matter how many cars you hit him with or how high the building he falls off is he'll be back and fighting again 10 seconds later. It's best to switch your brain off at these points I have found.Finally I loved the main villain in this movie played excellently by Bill Skarsgård. He was everything a villain should be. Calm and seemingly in control menacing and easy for the audience to hate and root against.This film was a blast from start to finish. 9/10.,23 March 2023
Bonjour Monsieur Wick,John Wick series have always been over-the-top action / thriller joyrides more focused on dazzling you with visceral expertly choreographed action sequences than trying to tell the most coherent stories about stylish assassins. Director Chad Stahelski's John Wick: Chapter 4 is no exception. And it abundantly delivers on the franchise's hallmarks - snazzy guns lovable dogs and one very haggard man in black. John Wick: Chapter 4 isn't a movie you casually sit down to watch apropos of nothing. It's a commitment both in terms of how long it is and in how invested you really have to be in the idea of John Wick for the film to be engaging. To its credit John Wick: Chapter 4 does an admirable job of leaving open possibilities for a future filled with stories of some of the movie's new supporting characters. It comes as a pleasant surprise given how much time this story spends trying to remind you that Wick is the baddest man in town. It's a movie that's meant to be watched loud and big. Remember ! John Wick has fought hard for it.,17 March 2023
May possibly be the best John Wick but is absolutely the most John Wick.,That lasted 169 minutes? I had no idea. The time just flew right by.Chad Stahelski does not pull any punches (or engage the safety) at any time in this gun-fu epic. Combat scenes are not moments so much as they are entire acts. The amount of stunt choreography that everybody had to synchronize to was rather incredible and they continue to find more ways to entertain us with kills kill types use of weapons locations teamwork etc. I caught myself smiling for minutes on end several times while watching it.Of course though as I said they really lean into it. I'm sure this has been true of previous films as well but it is very apparent that John Wick should virtually die in every scene that he is in. Whether it is how he is attacked or how they fail to attack him at the right times he goes at every foe like the bear in The Revenant with full adrenaline and no signs of slowing down no matter what he is hit by. And again I think if you look hard enough you will find enemies who have clear shots and choose not to take them because of plot armor but you can forgive it enough if you're rewarded with a longer take or overall longer action sequence. What I really loved was how many of these scenes took place at night with dazzlingly lit environments all around and the music in every scene kicks as much *** as what you see on screen. I had pondered over why John Wick doesn't have a video game yet but if they ever make one I have decided I'd like one of those top-down shooter games (similar to The Hong Kong Massacre and if not maybe like the GTA:SA MP rampage style).I acknowledge this franchise for what it is now but I still pine for some of the missing components that I don't know if it'll ever be able to bring back. After watching John Wick fun as it was I found myself interested in seeing a prequel when he was the Baba Yaga in his prime taking missions rather than being hunted. Even still at least in that movie he was absolutely feared. In Chapter 2 I still found him heavily respected but it was in that movie that I realized there would probably be a repetitive formula to the narrative and movie/action structure (which still has yet to break). In Chapter 3 there only lived assassins and they would go after him without hesitation which did is not how I felt the world breathed the first time around. They continue down this path in Chapter 4 while opening the universe more to different characters breeding their own kind of loyalty. They are all insanely fun to watch and you see the cogwheels of the John Wick universe spinning with the future Continental television show and the Ballerina movie spinoff. Where they remain faulty though is even with the existence of civilians during fight scenes they act as droning NPC's like nothing is happening around them or they aren't there whatsoever. It is clear that this is not our world that this movie takes place in but rather a parallel one.I mentioned the introduction of new characters in this world and you can't not bring up Donnie Yen when talking about them. He steals each and every scene that he is in and it's crazy because you wonder how a character like his could thrive in such a world but you absolutely believe it when you watch it. I will absolutely take more of him and Rina Sawayama. She isn't featured as much but she makes use of every second that she is in front of the camera. There are plenty of others (such as the great Hiroyuki Sanada) but the point remains that Wick is relegated to this greater universe with characters who-good bad or for themselves-are ones we can actually root for in any fight. Keanu Reeves is understandably less nimble at his age than the others (and it's either bad acting or he really has taken on this John Wick role in his line delivery to hilarious new heights) but he and Stahelski have found a groove that still makes him the most impenetrable force around to the point that I go back and watch the action scenes in The Matrix Resurrections and wonder what happened there. I didn't love one particular character in their big fighting moment(s) but they go for versatility and I have to give them that much.March has had an incredible run of theatrical films and John Wick: Chapter 4 is no different. You will lean forward during the action which there is plenty and if I'm one to go off of you will not feel the runtime. There is an end credits scene as well if you're able to stay for a moment longer. I would love to go back and see this one again.,17 March 2023
There is such a thing as too much,"The Table the international crminal brotherhood which has condemned John Wick empowers The Marquis to deal with him (and the Manager of the New York Continentale Hotel). But maybe just maybe there is a way out.As expected the IMDB is full of people saluting this as ""Best John Wick yet"" ""A masterpiece"" ""Best action movie ever"" etc. My view differs. But I must start by giving credit where it is due. Production design cinematography action choreography and direction are all first rate and they deserved a much better film that this is. And this film deserved a much better script than this.The story is fine quite good even but it is buried under industrial quantities of action which defies belief. Everbody's resistance to trauma and the complete absence of police are just the big two but let's not forget the endless succession of pairs of heavies coming out of nowhere and only stopping when Wick has no gun.And even the scriot deserved a better actor than Keanu Reeves. To be fair the character in the first film has been reduced to a mere cardboard cutout here but Reeves (who I genuinely like as a performer) doesn't even play cardboard well here.This is beautifully crafted drivel. 7 for craft 3 for Reeves' central performance averages to 5.",30 March 2023
Loving Husband,As Mr Wick nears the end of his journey we are given a delight of a story well structured across its constant world building. It gives a never-ending stream of new structural and actionable aspects that feel natural as it progresses from the action to plot points and personal development. An intertwining of interests rooted in common found circumstances history connection as well as coincidence and luck. As he came back into this life a free man he wills to fight to leave just as he came no matter the cost. As the nature of it expands with new and unsurprising aspects this feature more than delivers and entertains.,25 March 2023
It got on my wick.,The first three John Wick films came in fairly quick succession with only five years between the first and third chapters each film trying to top the one before in terms of wild set pieces. For me it all became a bit too much the action rapidly becoming too frenetic and over-the-top. By Parabellum (part three) I had had enough.I hoped that the four years between Parabellum and this fourth entry in the franchise had given me a big enough breather that I might be able to find new appreciation for the excessive mayhem. If anything I found Chapter 4 even more tiresome: the fight scenes as technically excellent as they are simply don't know when to quit and they're even more ridiculous than ever. Wick has been established as a semi-mythical being (Baba Yaga) seemingly impervious to pain and injury meaning that the character is never in any real peril which generates zero jeopardy or excitement. If anything the relentless action scenes result in boredom being mind-numbingly repetitive and far-fetched (the whopping 2 hours 49 minutes runtime doesn't help).Director Chad Stahelski pushes plausibility way beyond breaking point with a protracted melee amidst the traffic around the Arc De Triomphe that somehow fails to attract the attention of the Paris gendarmerie; an even more dumb scene (in a film packed with dumb scenes) sees nightclub revellers continuing to dance while people are being shot and axed to death all around them. The final act - a duel between John and blind warrior Caine (Donnie Yen) - takes place outside the Basilica of Sacré-Coeur de Montmartre at dawn with not a single tourist or passerby to alert the authorities of what is occurring.I've been known to enjoy comic-book action films that aren't exactly grounded in reality but John Wick 4 seems to take place in an alternate universe where none of our rules apply. Since very little of what we see in this film can be believed I definitely don't swallow the idea that John Wick is actually dead at the end (although I sincerely hope he is).Those claiming that this is the best action film ever made have clearly never seen The Raid 2 (or any early John Woo film or The Night Comes For Us or Ong-Bak or Born To Fight or Eastern Condors or In The Line of Duty IV or.... well you get the idea).,25 March 2023
"""Yeah.""",In this fourth installment of 8711's successful franchise Keanu Reeves wearily drags himself from setpiece to setpiece saying little surviving the most ridiculous setups and finally achieves nothing.The acting and writing of JOHN WICK: CHAPTER 4 are indeed the worst aspects of this film and the exaggerated runtime of almost three hours doesn't help.Try to remember John Wick's motivation to do all the things he does. What exactly is he actually doing escpecially in this one? In addition to a lack of motivation Chapter 4 is a remarkable retcon in the sense that John Wick could have ended the hunt for his person way earlier thus making at least the last two installments redundant.There's plenty of action here sure but it has been getting more and more unrealistic and so you'll be in a situation where your suspension of disbelief says bye-bye especially when you contrast the growing ridiculousness of the action with John Wick's decreasing vigour.The plot has some toddler level plot holes and contrivances which are really distracting yes even in an action no-brainer like this. Keanu Reeves has maybe ten lines of dialogue in the whole movie. The Marquis is a nonsense character just like Donnie Yen's Caine character. They just appear but especially in Caine's case you're supposed to be emotional about it because he's basically John Wick's brother from another mother. We just never knew about him. Oh well.This is the definition of a dumb movie for dumb people and if you just want to enjoy some nice shots and over-the-top action (some of which is really nice) AND love Keanu Reeves this is your jam. If you need a bare minimum of consistency and structure you might feel cheated.,24 March 2023
Action masterpiece,John Wick: Chapter 4 is an action masterpiece an emotionally investing unashamedly pretentious and extremely satisfying final chapter that continues to celebrate stunt work as the art form it absolutely is and deliver franchise high spectacle that really does put the majority of other action films to shame.Keanu Reeves is even more agile than ever and continues to really impress in the action despite being 4 films in. Once again though it's not just the action he excels at with the sense of finality this time around adding a sombre and contemplative nature to his performance that is beautiful.The supporting cast is insanely stacked a definite new record for this franchise. Ian McShane and Lawrence Fishburne play to their familiar strengths and really dial them up. Then there's the newcomers starting with Shamier Anderson who has a really interesting angle to his character that's a lot of fun.Rina Sawayama makes a terrific screen debut and has great chemistry with Hiroyuki Sanada who can do no wrong and his reunion with Reeves is a joy to see. Bill Skarsgård is another memorable villain for this franchise as a character who dresses like a gentleman but acts like the complete opposite.Scott Adkins plays against type in hilarious fashion and then there's Donnie Yen. Obviously he's perfect in the action scenes and just so cool but on top that he's one of the best characters because his conflict with John isn't as black and white as previous antagonists making it all the more interesting.Chad Stahelski's direction is phenomenal the action scenes are still super clean and impeccably choreographed. There's a nightclub scene that actually improves over the original a fight in oncoming traffic that's jaw droppingly good and a one take that is one of the best of all time.The film also offers an excellent reminder that Stahelski is an amazing visual stylist as well. With Dan Laustsen's cinematography he creates a beautifully film that makes each location visually unique and the lighting in particular is just stunning throughout.The pacing is so good gaining momentum early on and never letting up. The music by Tyler Bates and Joel J. Richard is once again incredible bringing back all the greatest hits without solely relying on them and actually creating the most unique score of the four with plenty of new pieces.,25 March 2023
One of the most beautiful and hyperkinetic action films ever!,"""John Wick: Chapter 4"" is one of the most captivating exciting eye-popping hyperkinetic and beautiful action films ever made. Director Chad Stahelski has done the unthinkable; he has outdone himself in this fourth entry by taking a two hour and forty-nine-minute runtime (the longest in the series) and making it feel an hour shorter. This is a combat magnum opus a relentless sensory experience gorgeously hyperviolent and easily the best in the series.Baba Yaga is once again fighting to defeat the High Table while also facing a devilish and powerful new adversary (a disquieting and deviously memorable performance by Bill Skarsgärd as Marquis) in death-defying blood-spurting neon-blasting stunts-to-spare well-groomed high-fashion style. Yes the plot is rather simple straightforward and lacking in in-depth character background but that hasn't been the strength of any of the Wick films anyway.The masterful elements at play in ""Chapter 4"" begin with its colorful even extravagant and likeable supporting characters including Laurence Fishburne as the crafty Bowery Clancy Brown as the cryptic Harbinger Donnie Yen - electrifying as the blind yet intuitive Caine - and most terrifically Shamier Anderson as Tracker - a shady spy-like character that gives an indelible performance that ranges from brutal toughness to vulnerable subjugation.Add heart-pounding sound effects and a pulsating musical score striking nighttime dark and gritty noir-inspired cinematography and masterful fighting choreography that frames Wick in different cities with sumptuous vistas across the globe (the locales are outstanding from Sacré Coeur to Arc de Triomphe to the Louvre to the Eiffel Tower in France to the opening scene in Aqaba Jordan plus Berlin and Tokyo) and you end up with what feels like the most edgy revolutionary and most James Bond-esque entry yet.The elaborate and visceral set designs are ""Chapter 4's"" crowning achievement; lavish and rich with detail they put Wick in elegant and high-tech rooms ornate buildings rousing nightclubs and most memorably a long flight of stairs and heavily trafficked streets where gut-wrenching head-popping fighting sequences ensue. It's a WICKedly wild ride from beginning to end that left me breathless gasping and exclaiming ""wow!"" in wonderment.",24 March 2023
Oh wow..,I absolutely am amazed by this film I wasn't expecting it to be that brilliant whenever the camera zooms out into the city's omg my mouth dropped the fights are like 45 to 35 mins and it's extremely brutal and the reason I'm reviewing on 23rd is cause UK released it early and I watched it at 6pm today it was absolutely amazing and brilliant the new villians was wow crazy marquis tracker Caine and many more the ending was unexpected and very sad there's no slow moments it's extremely intense and gruesome in parts so it's not for the faint of heart this film should be 18 in UK idk how it got 15 but I recommend ppl over 14+ can handle it I hope everyone enjoys this film 10/10 best film of the year if I had to rank it John wick 3 John wick 1 John wick 2 and my number 1 is John wick chapter 4 so that's my review on John wick chapter 4 I hope everyone likes the review.,23 March 2023
John Wick became the parody of himself. The true identity of this franchise is completely lost.,"I went to the cinema with great expectations. I have to admit that the photography is gorgeous the locations are wonderful and the action sequences are well coordinated. However I feel that the true identity of this franchise was completely lost with this fourth chapter. The first two movies for me are the best because the stunts look more credible. ""Parabellum"" started to drop in quality but it was still a solid flick. Here John suddenly became a superhero that can take any hit and can fall from every height and he can just keep going like nothing happened. When Chad Stahelski directed the first movie he was not expecting all this success and when the production company ordered sequels he did not really know how to develop this saga. Now it is one of the biggest action franchises with a TV show that will be aired in the future and maybe with a 5th entry that was already approved. This got definitely out of hand and Wick basically became the parody of himself with scenes that have forced comedic moments that do not quite deliver. In my perspective they really do not know what to invent anymore. I really hope that in the future screenwriters and the director will come up with better ideas because it is a series with potential and it showed it in the previous chapters but in this case it just felt pointless and purposeless.",24 March 2023
Damp Wick,No idea how the ratings are as high as they are. If you thought the first one was enjoyable but the 3rd one was bull read on.Just as the body count in the 3rd was ridiculous this is even more absurd. Seems after coming up with the bullet proof suit the writers etc thought it a good idea to make sure everyone has one. These giant men sent to kill Wick all wearing suits raising the jacket to protect their heads was a sight I found so funny. He's the best hitman on the world how do we kill him? I know we'll send a blind man!! Pathetic. And he can dodge bullets and he knows where everyone is. You could say it looked choreographed.Now about the DJ! They may have well cut the scenes directly from the Warriors. Better film done better and that isn't a great film. For those of you who have never heard of the Warriors go watch it. For those of you that have skip this nonsense.,5 April 2023

High energy and wonderfully excessive as it delivers an engaging true story but the lack of morality anywhere was a limiting factor,"This film arrived in the UK with awards and Oscar nominations all around it adding an expectation which it really didn't need adding since even without any of that it is ultimately a Scorsese film with a big name cast. It also arrives with some other stuff because the film has been criticized for near glamorization of the excesses that Belfort was able to experience with his ill-gotten funds and to be honest it is an impression that isn't helped when you consider that this film was put forward to the Golden Globes in the Musical/Comedy section. Now I am sure that was a political move by the studio but it does say something about the film because indeed for most of it we have stuff so unbelievable and so excessive that it is hard not to laugh at it. It is hard not to enjoy it.And this is a problem because the first 2 hours and a bit of this film is really engaging and enchanting in how much of a rush it gives you how enticing it is and just how much vibrant energy it all has. The viewer is swept along and I guess to a point this is the film doing its job well because not only are we being told a story but we are first hand seeing how easy it is to get caught up in the grab for success for money for status. In this regard the film works really well because throughout the film I really was glad to be part of it and wanted it for myself; I don't think the film goes out of its way to glamorize this excess and this life but for sure it doesn't do much to balance it – and this really is my problem with the film.The structure subjects and delivery of this film is so inherently similar to Goodfellas that it is hard not to mention it. If you remember the opening of Goodfellas you'll remember that it opens with a memorably violent scene where an near-dead man in the back of a car is stabbed by Hill and his colleagues in a scene that is oppressive and violent but yet ends with the narration telling us ""as far back as I can remember I wanted to be a gangster"" and snaps to credits under a big track from Tony Bennett. This scene is important because it works as a microcosm of the whole film – the appeal but also the cost all in one place. Wolf of Wall Street never has any of that and it hurts it. I suspect the message of the film is that our financial systems are screwed and that ultimately the rich will never be in the same world as the average person because this is what I took from the rather sobering final scenes. However if this is the point it is trying to make then it really hurts itself with the rest of the film seeming to say ""so why not get on board"". I know this is not the case but the lack of a ""point"" or an agenda it the film means that it naturally fills it with its own which is a weird feeling.But then again – I guess it is a comedy. So the infamous Quaalude scene is not horrific but rather hilarious the scenes of excess and of criminality are not equally appealing and repulsive – they are almost totally appealing we hardly get the other side or get to see a victim here and a few seconds on the subway with the FBI agent really does nothing but yet again make the suggestion that ""it's all broken so why not at least get rich yourself"". Getting away from this it is a well made film. Scorsese makes this award season's second film to owe a massive debt to Goodfellas (American Hustle being the other) and he directs the film with energy; music is used well as one would expect and the editing makes the film pop. DiCaprio is great in the lead – OK he doesn't find the heart of the character but the film doesn't ask him to. Instead he is charismatic and energetic drawing the viewer in and giving the film its energy. The supporting cast is deep with names and familiar faces and it is a statement about how well the film holds the viewer because it isn't distracting no matter how many famous faces or supporting character from TV appear (although I did notice that this and American Hustle had lots of faces from HBO's Boardwalk Empire). Jonah Hill is over the top in a way that works although I am surprised to see him getting an Oscar nomination for it in such a crowded year.Wolf of Wall Street has had a lot of praise and this will continue as the Oscars approach and are awarded. Personally I enjoyed the film as a funny true story delivered with energy and excess but in many ways it is not Goodfellas and the most important of these is that the film lacks a moral core to itself to its characters and to its message. I don't mind the ""it's all screwed so who cares"" message that it ultimately seems to give but I didn't feel comfortable with how wide a smile it had on its face while it was delivering it.",17 January 2014
SELL ME THIS PEN,"Golden Globe winner Leonardo DiCaprio stars in the title role of Jordan Belfort. Belfort works his way up the ladder making money in penny stocks i.e. ""selling garbage to garbage men."" His scheme is to sell these garbage stocks to rich investors due to the high commissions. Along the way he does some illegal transactions as he runs his corporation like a frat party in ""Animal House."" Having not known money he and his crew are ill equipped to handle it.I thought that Jonah Hill gave one of his best performances. The production is awfully long not wanting to miss out on any details. The film goes into detail to explain to the audience things like IPO and the history and effects of quaaludes. If you note the ludes he took early in the film were crumbly. Those were non-prescription ludes made from a pill press in uncle Vinnie's garage and not too potent. Later they score some real ludes. Having taken the fake ones for so long they didn't know how to handle them causing them to crash like the money it was too much too fast.The main criticism of the film is that it featured over 500 F-bombs. It really didn't seem like that many due to the length of the production. Besides you get numb to it after the first few hundred or so.",4 October 2018
Oscar worthy,The movie Leonardo DiCaprio should have gotten an Oscar for. His portrayal of the character is perfect. The movie is well-written leaving no details out of the original story. Martin Scorsese never fails to impress. One of the only example where the movie is better than the book. The movie never gets boring I could watch this anytime.,29 December 2020
Awesome movie watched it multiple times,"This film is every definition of the word ""impeccable."" Scorcese's fantastic storytelling ability mixed with phenomenal acting from DiCaprio Hill and the rest of the cast makes for an awesome combination. The film is never boring and gives you a glimpse into the life of a man who had everything in the world only to have it taken away.",23 February 2020
It really is a comedy,"There is a reason this is called Wolf of Wall Street and not Lion of Wall Street. This is not supposed to be a story about some good guy or misunderstood guy doing things that are a little off. And therefor it was important to make this a comedy. When I watched it I didn't think it would qualify as comedy. Thought of it more of a drama with some comedic moments thrown in.The way it starts should indicate if this is something you want to watch. Never forget as someone else also stated this is supposed to be entertainment and does not take itself seriously. If you are not on that level with the movie you will call it names. And that is OK because obviously the movie is out there and it will not be everyones taste. That's why you have to decide early on if you actually want to watch it or not.If you don't feel like it don't watch it. Save yourself some time and watch something else that interests you instead. If it hits a nerve with you though you will revel in it. Especially in the performance Leonardo Di Caprio is giving. There is a scene involving him driving ""carefully"" that has to be seen to be believed ...",18 June 2014
My favorite movie of the 2010's,What can I say. This is such a great movie. I remember seeing this for the first time not really knowing what it was about. Straight from the first scene it immediately put a smile on my face which lasted about for the rest of the entire movie. Great entertainment I love over the top movies like this. I haven't seen something this good since Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. I have seen it about 4 times again since it came out and I just keep loving it. The only downside was maybe the scene with the ludes and the Lamborghini. Even though it was great maybe it was a bit too much over the top :),15 October 2021
DiCaprio gives the best performance of his career.,"In the mid-1990s Jordan Belfort (Leonardo DiCaprio) and the rest of his associates from brokerage firm Stratton Oakmont became the very definition of excess and debauchery their offices a boiler room fueled by cocaine and greed. High pressure sales tactic and less-than-legal behind-the-scenes manipulation bred plenty of twenty-something millionaires and Belfort built himself an empire at the top of the heap. His rise and fall is chronicled in The Wolf of Wall Street based on the memoir of the same name.Under most circumstances the actions of Belfort and his cronies (including Jonah Hill in a howlingly funny turn as Belfort's business partner) would be viewed as disgustingly abhorrent but Martin Scorsese frames this tale of greed with a comedic lens that allows us to laugh at things we probably shouldn't find humorous. Whether it's a clumsy attempt at fisticuffs between two characters overdosing on Quaaludes or the categorization of prostitutes using stock market terminology (""blue chip"" hookers make you wear a condom and typically accept credit cards) the film is outrageous from start to finish and rarely falters in its quest to entertain the audience for three hours.Belfort manages to delude himself and his pals into thinking they can live like this forever but the audience knows better and Belfort's eventual comeuppance is hardly surprising. But the path is paved with hilarity especially in a scene aboard the mogul's luxury yacht where he surreptitiously offers a pair of FBI agents everything from booze to girls to cold hard cash in exchange for their silence. And let's not forget his punishment for drunkenly piloting a helicopter into the backyard of his estate at 3am raising the ire of his trophy wife (Margot Robbie).Scorsese has always managed to elicit astounding performances from his actors and his fifth collaboration with Leonardo DiCaprio results in one of the most charismatic despicable offensive and captivating characters to ever appear on screen. As financial bad boy Belfort DiCaprio swaggers from scene to scene ingesting eye-popping amounts of narcotics groping and fondling nearly every female within reach and spouting more profanity in three hours than an entire season of The Sopranos. Belfort is the kind of person that any sane person would detest in real life but thanks to Scorses and DiCaprio we can't take our eyes off him.-- Brent Hankins www.nerdrep.com",24 December 2013
"""Money is the oxygen of capitalism and I wanna breathe more than any other human being alive.""","It's no surprise that Scorsese is associated with the gangster genre with films such as The Departed Goodfellas and Casino of which the last two are possibly the best pure examples of the genre. In Goodfellas the gangsters are dangerous but they operate on a more underground level in Casino they practically run a major city and can do whatever they like. The gangsters were and will always be a part in America's system. Now the gangsters are not just accepted by the system but are considered to be an integral part of it. In the first two films the gangster is threatening and dangerous but avoidable. In The Wolf of Wall Street he's calling to hustle you at home and you don't even know it. Some people view The Wolf of Wall Street as a glorification of Jordan Belfort's lifestyle and want to be like him as Scorsese portrays this life by its nature enticing. That's the way it works and it's impossible to portray it accurately without showing how a charismatic man like Belfort can suck an unsuspecting person into a world of money and fame. The film though shows us just how empty and destructive that life can be.There is an undeniable similarity between the instantaneous joy energy and euphoria that we have while watching The Wolf of Wall Street and how Jordan Belfort lives his life this is a movie where the director skillfully mixes form and content to create an experience which is as hyper and as instantly ecstatic as the life of its flashy and opportunistic characters.The direction by Martin Scorsese which still has infectious energy and power is impeccable there is no other director who has mastered pacing like he has. This is a three-hour movie that moves lightning fast and always manages to keep the audience invested in the story throughout the whole duration. Each scene is packed with so much visual information and it is fast paced and quickly edited which complements the general tone of the film. The cinematography by Rodrigo Prieto is gorgeous as well and displays an optimal color palette throughout the whole film. Each shot also looks precise even during some of the more chaotic scenes.The script is fantastic filled with many great and memorable lines of dialogue. Every character has a well-defined arc and motives and the story is given proper breathing room to blossom. The performances are also exquisite especially Leonardo DiCaprio who gives one of the best performances of his career and portrays the opportunistic nature of Jordan Belfort's character with great commitment as you can see a lustful hedonistic and impulsive sex & drug-addict man who only wants to have more fun. Supporting him with equal passion is Jonah Hill as Donnie Azoff Belfort's sidekick and even he manages to make a mark of his own. Margot Robbie plays Naomi Belfort's second wife and she does an alluring job in her given role. Matthew McConaughey is in for a very short duration as Mark Hanna Belfort's mentor but even in that little time he is the show-stealer and he dominates the screen unlike anyone else.Martin Scorsese and Terence Winter set out to create a film about the Wall Street excess and by definition it contains an excessive amount of everything such as cursing sex nudity drugs alcohol and partying. But the film is not really about those things. The story of The Wolf of Wall Street boils down to money that ""most-addictive drug"" Belfort speaks of and not just what it can buy but what it can do to people. Not just how it changes one's lifestyle but the effects it has on one's morals beliefs and values and how it can effectively change not just how a person thinks and feels but how they operate at their core.With a collection of truly incredible films The Wolf of Wall Street stands out as one of Scorsese's best films my personal favorite and by far his most humorous film to date. He truly went all out and it paid off in a hilarious satire on the reverence of money drugs women and the admiration of a criminal money-maker. The Wolf of Wall Street is maddening cinema that's already high on coke but still continues to snort more white powder every 5 minutes for 3 hours. This is a fascinating vignette of excess greed abuse and decay and it's one of the best movies of the decade and surely one of the most entertaining movies ever made.",24 October 2018
The best movie of 2013,The movie is just the best the acting is great and even I say that it was Oscar-worthy and the plot is simply one of the best ones; the message that it brings to you that money brings power and it is not always for the best because in this movie we see the downfall of a man that will learn that actually in life the money can be a drug and will simply make you cause damage to yourself.,22 September 2021
The Wolf of Wall Street is Leonardo DiCaprio's Crowning Work,"Martin Scorsese has done it again. His newest and most refreshing effort he's contributed to the world of cinema in years The Wolf of Wall Street is a roaring thrill ride that is both absolutely hilarious and meticulously constructed. It also presents Academy Award nominee Leonardo DiCaprio in possibly his finest acting performance of his career. At one-minute shy of three hours I was both engaged and hypnotized nearly the entire duration. A comedic epic that studies the behavior and cultures of a time in America feels like the uncovering of a time capsule that was buried and dug up to give insight into our current financial crisis. Much more than just laughs it turns on the dramatic elements early enough in the film to warrant considerable reactions about the choices of our key characters. Expertly paced with intelligent moral questions presented The Wolf of Wall Street is one of the best films of the year.Telling the story of Jordan Belfort a young Wall Street broker that gets involved in drugs money and even more drugs during the 80's and 90's. In his tenure trading (and stealing) Jordan marries divorces does drugs marries again does even more drugs makes solid friendships and believe it or not does a lot more drugs. Watching the destruction of Jordan acted as a documentarian's insight that felt like I was watching ""Intervention"" without the family that cares. The Wolf of Wall Street is a black comedy giving hints of drama. Natural comparisons will fly to Oliver Stone's Wall Street which is accurate but you can see subtle hints of films like Trading Places Glengarry Glen Ross and even American Psycho. That's a testament to Scorsese's outstanding direction and Terence Winter's masterful screenplay. Scorsese keeps Wolf life-size sprinkled with characters that are both geniuses and morons but functioning morons. They're like the frat pack group that sat in a corner on my college campus being loud and obnoxious and made terrible life choices that they still aren't aware of until this day. Scorsese puts together an all-star cast to inhabit these beings that includes DiCaprio Jonah Hill Margot Robbie Matthew McConaughey Jon Bernathal and Kyle Chandler. All of which seem to be having the time of their lives.A lot of the credit of the film's overall success has to be awarded to Leonardo DiCaprio. I've never seen him truly ""go for it"" in a way that he exhibits as Jordan Belfort. In his breaking of the fourth wall to his long but completely engaging monologues about life money and greed it's the most assured and compelling work by the actor to date. When DiCaprio unleashed his talents in the mid-90's in What's Eating Gilbert Grape? and later stole the hearts of tween girls everywhere in Titanic who knew this is the role he'd been gearing up to play. This is the role of his career and something that the Academy Awards should look to for his long overdue recognition. It's a charming and adventurous turn that presents a conundrum to the audience as we find ourselves both enamored and loathing the pure essence of Jordan. A sequence of DiCaprio crawling on the floor will probably be the scene of the year. This is DiCaprio's crowning achievement.As the magnetic and cheesy-minded right-hand man Jonah Hill's performance as Donnie Azoff is another great turn for the 30-year-old actor. He's allowed to explore some of his comedic ticks and beats that he may not have ever had the opportunity to explore in films like Superbad or 21 Jump Street. In Wolf he relies on his own instincts and his chemistry with DiCaprio which has helped him before for his Oscar-nominated work in Moneyball opposite Brad Pitt. Matthew McConaughey is one scene shy of winning the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. While his work in Dallas Buyers Club will bring him the acclaim and recognition that he deserves The Wolf of Wall Street is a prime example of what he should be doing when he's not working or seeking out the strong independent features that are geared for awards recognition. Stealing every frame and focus from DiCaprio in his ten minute screen time McConaughey utilizes all his charm and spunk as Mark Hanna the mentor to young Jordan as he started out.Like any great Scorsese film the women are in full-force and given the opportunity to shine like the others. Cristin Millotti a toned down and tragic version of Marisa Tomei in My Cousin Vinny is sensational in her brief appearances on screen. Beautiful and sympathetic she offers much needed serious and dramatic elements to Jordan's outrageous antics. In the end a star is born in the gorgeous and vivacious Margot Robbie as Naomi Lapaglia Jordan's second wife. Whoever was going to be cast as Naomi had to be an actress of considerable talent and had the ability to really be the sexy kitten but still warrant an emotional reaction from the audience when called upon. Margot Robbie was the perfect choice and she'll need to owe Scorsese royalties for years to come with the roles she'll be offered following this. Robbie is pure magic and is everything she's required to be. She's the more elusive compelling and more thought out version of Scarlett Johansson's character in Don Jon.I loved every second of The Wolf of Wall Street. Terence Winter's script is a natural and well-oiled machine that produces the words of a demigod. You couldn't make these things up. Thelma Schoonmaker is the utmost professional and continues to shine film after film. You won't find another dedicated and glossed editing work this year. The other supporting actors do sensational work especially Kyle Chandler who has a very well-constructed exchange on a boat with DiCaprio has us asking more and more why is this guy not helming his own films on a consistent basis yet?",17 December 2013
Reserved for the male of the species,The Wolf Of Wall Street details the rise and fall in real life of one Jordan Belfort who for a while was living high and wide off of other people's money. It was good while it lasted until some relentless FBI agents took him down partly because of his own hubris.Leonardo DiCaprio as he did with such other real life figures like Howard Hughes and J. Edgar Hoover each of who lived large in his own way with power DiCaprio lives large with money. At first it's the realization of the American dream DiCaprio the middle class kid wants to go on Wall Street. He goes but then is one of thousands cast adrift by the stock market crash of the late Reagan years. DiCaprio is not about to give up his dream.He organizes his own brokerage house similar to what is seen in the more modestly financed film The Boiler Room. But DiCaprio takes it far from a penny stock outfit. With a collection of his own ill assorted bunch of friends chief among them is Jonah Hill these guys and I do mean it is reserved for the male of the species DiCaprio makes obscene amounts of money and spends it obscenely. That is sure to attract all kinds of law enforcement attention.I have seen very few films that have depicted the alpha male world so well. Women just do not compete in DiCaprio's world. All they serve as are sex objects. Women work on Wall Street in the more traditional brokerage houses but not with him where being one of the boys is the first requirement. The world consists of 50% orgies and 50% piling up paper profits and later on hiding them from authorities. True of DiCaprio and true to a lesser extent of all his associates.Martin Scorsese directed this film and handled the film like he did one of his gangster epics like Goodfellas. The narration of the film is by DiCaprio and it takes you from his rise to where law enforcement has him between a rock and a hard place. Like Ray Liotta in Goodfellas a combination of drugs and hubris makes him think he's invulnerable. But in Goodfellas would not have had a scene where the wise guys just out and out dared to challenge the FBI as DiCaprio does with agent Kyle Chandler. It so reminded me of that famous incident from 1984 where presidential candidate Gary Hart dares reporters to follow him around to catch him doing anything outside his marriage. And of course they did.Five Oscar nominations went to The Wolf Of Wall Street nominations for Best Picture Best Director Best Adapted Screenplay and nominations for DiCaprio and Jonah Hill as Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor. Hill was something of a revelation. The kind of nondescript character that you wouldn't look at twice Hill gets taken to a world that he could only imagine in dreams wet or dry by DiCaprio. In his own Hill is almost as fascinating a story as DiCaprio.The guy who beat Leo out for Best Actor has a brief but telling role as a mentor of sorts. Matthew McConaughey plays a stockbroker who takes him under his wing and they have a great scene at a club where he's getting his first three martini lunch. McConaughey only forgets to teach DiCaprio one thing discretion.I can understand why women would truly hate this film as they are nothing more than pawns in a male power game but The Wolf Of Wall Street gives us a fascinating look at a man who tried to play with the big boys of the Stock Exchange and for a while did.,11 April 2014
Wolf of Wall Street review,If you've seen The Goodfellas or Casino then you'll know the story of The Wolf of Wall Street. This is another tale of a criminal whose ambitions sweep him away into a debauched world of dirty money out-of-control substance abuse endless lies a troubled family life and a downward spiral of corruption that inevitably leads to his own undoing. Only thing is this is less about the gangsters and mafia and more about white-collar crime. The guys wear suits work in proper offices and everything they do is just business; funnily enough this whole movie still plays out like a kind of gangster film.Based on the memoirs of Jordan Belfort - the real-life stock broker who made millions by selling shoddy stocks to average joes - the film showcases one seriously messed-up slimeball of a man. If his scheme sounds familiar it's because it's been the inspiration behind the 2000 film Boiler Room and this film covers much of the same concepts albeit with better structure. The film maintains a close and intimate focus on the man as he rises to power suckers thousands into his schemes and then lives a life of extreme excess. And it is extreme: the whole film becomes laden with drugs sex superficial luxuries material things and characters who want nothing more than to take and consume everything. The sheer corruption becomes palpable on-screen and I couldn't help but to shake my head at numerous scenes when I saw just how far these wolfish characters have gone in their unrestrained partying and debauchery. I have no clue as to how closely this film adapts the real-life events but at times it's almost hard to believe that things could have gone this far. And yet the excesses serve to underscore key themes and criticisms on the American dream; the pursuit of money and success through any means remains the main drive of the characters and the movie and it leads to a fairly hard-hitting downfall.This film features good-looking photography and editing. Acting is great: Leonardo DiCaprio is practically perfect as the titular character and the rest of the cast pulls their weight really well (including Jonah Hill who seems to fit into his character's archetype very comfortably). Writing is really sharp and good; the film is full of great lines and great speeches. There are some great-looking sets props and costumes on display in this film. Music has a varied mix of songs and they're all used really well for their intended effect.The Wolf of Wall Street is every bit as good as Martin Scorsese's previous work with The Goodfellas and Casino. All these films work with similar plots and themes but TWOWS is like a gangster film masked by the thin veil of upper-class corporate swindling. It is a film that candidly shows the crimes and excesses in full before proving that even for the super-rich crime still doesn't pay.Recommended! 4.5/5 (Entertainment: Good | Story: Very Good | Film: Perfect),29 December 2013
Scorsese and DiCaprio Make Another Masterpiece,The Wolf of Wall Street (2013)**** (out of 4) Two word review: A Masterpice.Martin Scorsese's latest film is yet another brilliant one with Leonard DiCaprio turning in the greatest performance of his career as stockbroker Jordan Belfort who takes some rather bland people and turn them into one of the biggest scams that the FBI ever saw. THE WOLF OF WALL STREET is going to make many people unhappy and there are many more who are probably going to be offended by it but the perfection that is Scorsese was right when he decided to turn this into a comedy instead of a drama. Yeah it's GOODFELLAS on speed and ramped up sex but it's just so brilliantly and wickedly funny that you can't help but laugh at all the craziness going on. Yes there are some moral police out there who are going to object to a movie being made about a man who ripped off poor people but I'm sorry I like the fact that this film doesn't really care about those people and instead just gives us an in-your-face look at these wild people their wild drugs and their wild sex lives. This film is certainly over-the-top in regards to the excess but so were the characters so I thought they just went hand and hand with each other. Scorsese was the perfect person for this project because of his ramped up speed but here is goes all out and really delivers an incredibly wicked little ride that will have you smiling and laughing at some very questionable things.I've been a fan of DiCaprio long before he became famous and this here is without question the greatest performance he's given so far. I was curious to see how he would do playing someone crazy and wild like this but he does so perfectly and I'd say it was a flawless performance. No matter what was going on in this crazy life you believe that you're watching a real character and as his character says throughout the film sell him something. Well DiCaprio sells this performance and role like no one else could. The supporting players are just as wonderful with Jonah Hill Margot Robbie Rob Reiner Jon Favreau Matthew McConaughey and Jean Dujardin all delivering terrific performances. The cinematography the music selections and everything else are just flawless here. THE WOLF OF WALL STREET could have been a complete disaster in so many ways but the strong screenplay and Scorsese's wicked direction makes it an incredibly entertaining film that works so well. It's hard to fully put into words what Scorsese and DiCaprio have pulled off but it's certainly one of the best and most memorable comedies in ages.,14 January 2014
A Three-Hour Bacchanalia Caught on Film,"Based on the true story of Jordan Belfort (Leonardo DiCaprio) from his rise to a wealthy stockbroker living the high life to his fall involving crime corruption and the federal government.As of now (February 2014) this film sits at an impressive #57 on IMDb's list of greatest films of all time. Using that as a jumping off point for this review we will have to scale it back a bit. Whether the film should be on the list is debatable but certainly not within the top 100 -- it is neither that good nor among director Martin Scorsese's best work.Along the same lines the Oscar nomination for Best Picture is a bit much. While there is no denying it was probably among the ten best films of 2013 with some incredible acting and more than adequate cinematography and editing the very fact it has no chance of winning makes one question why even nominate the film at all. (Of course without nine nominees we would be back to having the reasonable number of five...) Scorsese received a best director nomination and this strikes me as more understandable. He managed to assemble an impressive cast and tell a story that is both compelling and entertaining without trying to put some moral tag on it. Whether or not the viewer thinks this is a glorification or denouncement of the acts depicted is up to them as the film itself is blank (in the best way).While on the subject could the drug use and sexuality have been toned down? Absolutely. And there is a good argument that they should have been (especially the non-stop sex which comes across as gratuitous and only adds more minutes to this lengthy financial epic). Another argument says the events are extremely unlikely and exaggerated at times. And this is probably also true; but the film is accurate to the memoir not reality and this is Belfort telling his story with all the embellishments that come with it. If you want just the facts read the court transcripts.Leonardo DiCaprio is nominated for best actor and this is a choice that is understandable and yet hard to rally behind. He truly becomes Belfort and probably makes the man out to be even more wild than he was. That deserves a nomination. But this is not DiCaprio's best role (he has also done a fine job portraying Howard Hughes and J. Edgar Hoover) and not one he deserves the win for.Jonah Hill on the other hand was amazing and deserves to win his supporting actor category. Being up again Jared Leto he probably has no chance but Hill has come a long way in a few short years from a lovable doofus in ""Superbad"" to a formidable actor in his own right. At first ""Moneyball"" seemed to be an anomaly in Hil's career but he showed the world he could do even better when he became Donny Azoff in this picture. Incredible.Whether Terence Winter deserves Best Adapted Screenplay for this film is unclear without having read the book. Such a nomination seems fair though the win is hard to say without more familiarity. I am surprised no nominations came for cinematography or editing which are strong in their subtlety. But oh well.Of the film's five nominations it may walk away with one win (Winter) or two at most (DiCaprio). More likely it will walk away empty-handed. The film is not flawless (we could go on about how awkward the soundtrack was) and may or may not go on to be memorable for much more than its nudity and pervasive cursing.",3 February 2014
This is easily Leo's best performance ever!,This movie is absolutely amazing and it deserved way more Oscar wins. Leonardo DiCaprio is unbelievable and this movie is his best performance and he isn't the only one putting in an amazing performance this film is littered with them Jonah Hill is amazing Margot Robbie is so good to say this was her first major role. I love the story that this movie is telling and the direction on how they tell it is amazing aswell. This is easily one of the best movies of all time and it will go down in history as one of Leo's best ever movies. I love it so much!,15 November 2021
Leo's best performance of all time!!,Di caprio was robbed in the oscars whether you like it or not the only reason why people give this movie a low rating is because of the over nudity and it's the same reason why leo didn't get the oscar in my opinion which is what I don't understand!!! it's an r rated movie so obviously there will be nudity it's not a kid's movie!!!!  it's easily leo's best performance and scorcese's second best movie after goodfellas.,12 April 2021
Where Human Flaws Make a Rotten Core,"Brilliantly acted superbly written and as one would expect from a picture by Martin Scorsese it is a masterclass of directorial craft.Showy when it needs to be but also quiet and contemplative. ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is the equivalent of something like ""Good Fellas"" or even more so ""Casino"" but set in the world of finance. The suits might be more expensive but the people who wear them are just as sick and violent as their street-mob counterparts. Sardonic in humor and unflinching in showing the depravity of its characters it marks somewhat of a different approach to the world of stock-trading than Oliver Stone's ""Wall Street"".Where Stone seems more in line with Bertold Brecht who considered theater (or in this case film) a moral institution does Scorsese take the position of the omnipresent observer of the dark side of the American and in many cases the human dream.Leonard DiCaprio gives another stellar performance of great intensity and even greater tragedy while this tale of corruption greed and self-righteousness unfolds.It's a vast panorama that shows how during the last twenty-five to thirty years gullibility as well as our innate greed make all of us accomplices in this never-ending pyramid scheme far away from any reality.One could almost hear Scorsese's clerical background come to the fore again according to which nobody is without sin and therefore we are all susceptible to corruption.It is our decision on which side we choose to live that makes the difference.

over hyped movie!,Martin Scorsese is losing his gift as a director. The Wolf of Wall Street is another rendition of Scorsese's other movies. The narration actions and flow of Wolf of Wall Street is similar to Goodfellas Casino and Mean Streets. Di Capiro's lead character is just another version of the Henry Hill character from the movie Goodfellas. Through the streetwise narration of Di Capiro one learns how the system is scammed and experiences dysfunctional behaviour of drugs and prostitutes. The characters lack of morals creates the usual drama stew of low lives. Scorsese tries to spice up the old recycled formula with nudity massive drug use over the top sex which can not compensate for the lack of story depth. 3 hours was way too long for a half hour story. Five stars out of ten.,1 January 2014
Excess Is Boring Especially When It's Three Hours Long,"Martin Scorsese at his undisciplined worst.""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is 90 minutes of glib satire stretched over an interminable 180 minute film. I get it I get it -- the excess of the film itself matches the excess of the Wall Street world depicted in it. But excess both as a subject matter and as a style is boring after a while. The first hour or so of the film blows the roof off the joint and I was sure I was experiencing a film that would go down as one of Scorsese's best. But as it went on and on and Leonardo DiCaprio's performance became more and more histrionic and the film made the same point over and over I had that depressing feeling that comes when a movie you're really enjoying makes a wrong turn and becomes one you really dislike.""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is of course critic proof. Anyone who doesn't like it is instantly categorized by its fan boys as stodgy and unable to handle the subject matter as if it's an impossibility that someone could dislike the film simply because they don't think it's any good. Whatever. It's an overblown mess stupid when it's trying to be funny (the Quaalude scene for example) and in desperate need of someone who had the balls to tell one of America's greatest directors that he was letting his material run away with itself.Grade: C",9 January 2014
Goodfellas Meets Wall Street Meets Biting Black Comedy,""" The business of America is business "" screams an old cliché but like so many clichés it's based on reality . Is there much difference between a gangster and a stockbroker ? It's the sign of a very poor mobster who can't make a profit for his firm and it's the same with the stock market . Thankfully capitalism is legal and every other socio-economic alternative has been a disaster for humanity but one can't help equating the stock exchange with being the same as gangsterism  supply and demand without any moral or humanitarian mores and one wonders how American auteur Martin Scorsese might bring a story of Wall Street to screen ? If there's a problem with Scorsese he sometimes remakes the same type of film as in THE KING OF COMEDY and BRINGING OUT THE DEAD are remakes of TAXI DRIVER . likewise GOODFELLAS was remade as CASINO .One can't help thinking the temptation to make a story featuring an amoral capitalist could quite easily end up becoming a gangster film set in the world of high finance . "" All my life I wanted to be a white collar criminal "" In effect this is how the film works to a large degree but Scorsese is on top of his game so having such a large similarity on a narrative and visual level with GOODFELLAS and CASINO doesn't matter because for a movie lasting three hours it just flies by . Once again Scorsese uses the directorial technique of intensified continuity which is film critic speak for in your face direction . All the Scorsese hallmarks are here  breaking down the figurative fourth wall  garish and glossy cinematography  constant camera movement  pumping intrusive music etc etc . It's all here and you've seen it all before but it's so well done that none of this matters and remains totally compelling as once again the master director brings us Shakespearean tragedy in its most American and cinematic form To be fair to Jordan Belfort he didn't torture or kill anybody and his methods of gaining economic profit only differs from the rest of the finance sector in that they're illegal . Actually in amongst the excess of drugs  sex and foul language the storytelling doesn't make a very good job in telling the audience the difference between legal and illegal stockbroking but we're asked to take on board that Belfort isn't that bad because he's played by DiCaprio . Fair enough and he does a good job as a shallow and greedy boy who seduces stupid greedy people in handing over their cash . The rest of the cast also go along with the loud colourful style of the movie but was I puzzled by the one scene cameo by Mathew McConaughey in a pivotal role and kept expecting his character to make a reappearance at some point in the film which doesn't happen . . it'll be very ironic if as I expect McConaughey beats DiCaprio to the Oscar this year . A British audience might also find the casting of Joanna Lumley distracting in much the same way as Ray Winstone in THE DEPARTED  but the cinema audience I watched this with spent much of the running time laughing at the grotesque blackly comical scenes as they played out on screen . Mission accomplished Marty  although one can't help thinking an inclusion of a scene where Belfort passes a card warning a colleague about something is trying a little bit too hard to paint Belfort in a better light than he deserves . I mean it's not like anyone would be queuing up to listen to his lecture seminars after seeing this film is it now ? This is one of the better films from the long  prolific resume of Martin Scorsese  possibly his best since GOODFELLAS but one that will probably be very under rewarded at the prestigious award ceremonies due to one of the strongest film line ups seen in many years . It also won't convert anyone in to being a new found Scorsese fan but for those of us who's enjoyed his familiar language of cinema to tell a story about the American dream turning in to a nightmare it's proof once again that he's Hollywood's greatest living director.",21 January 2014
The Wolf of Wall Street was a pretty crazy movie. Not only did it sell the pen. The dark comedy concept sold the movie.,If this movie wasn't so outrageous mess up funny. It would be so unlikable to watch. In my opinion should had been call 'The Wolves of Wall Street'. Nobody has any morals balls in this movie as every character in this film is pretty greedy liars. They all felt like one-dimensional greed caricatures than human beings. Most of the character really need more well-rounded depth to them. Based on 2007's memoirs true story of Jordan Belfort. The movie focus on Jordan (Leonardo DiCaprio) rise to a wealthy stockbroker through the use of corruption scams; while under the watchful eyes of the federal government in the 1990s. The black comedy directed by Martin Scorsese is pretty well-made. Still it really felt too much of a glamorization of the lifestyle than a moral tale in my opinion. It felt like lets show as much f*ck up things as we can for 2 hours and then in the last few minutes show the negative results of what happen. It was bit one-sided argument. It made the film seem a bit unrealistic with how many crude things these people could get away with. This movie will likely inspiring others to do the same mistakes rather than teach them not to do what Belfort did. After all the real Belfort got paid for this movie a million dollar and a cameo. Since 2013 the opening of this movie Belfort hasn't pay enough money back to the victims of his crimes. The U.S. government is not holding Belfort in default of his payments but it is unclear when the full amount of the mandated restitution will ever be paid by him. He's pretty much got Scot free in his case and that really sucks to hear if he stole money from you. The acting is really alright. Leonardo DiCaprio can really put out the charm. He can also do the yelling that he been known for. He wasn't afraid of going over the top with this. Still this role wasn't anything new for him. After all he played similar characters in both 2013's Great Gatsby and 2002's Catch Me if you can. Instead of playing it straight he just went 100% crazy with this role with all the sex scenes and drug use. Honestly with all the drug use Jordan portray in the film doing how is this guy even alive? The one person that deeply surprise me was Jonah Hill as his partner in crime Donny Azoff. You really didn't see this type of acting coming from him. The supporting cast was pretty good for the most part. I have to say while his premise on film is short Matthew McConaughey as Mark Hanna Jordan's mentor was pretty memorable. The women characters were pretty typecast as trophy wives money hungry girlfriends or eye candy hookers who mostly go around full frontal nudity or having sex. If they're not doing that they portray as bitchy gold-diggers with no sense of morals. Margot Robbie is a pretty face but gees she couldn't act. At the beginning of her presence she had an Australian accent that made more sense since her aunt is British. Thenout of the blue you hear this awful screeching New Yorker/New Jersey Guido accent that sounds like something out of Jersey Shore. She couldn't show depth in her character if Martin Scorsese wanted to. It's really uncomfortable and offended how women were portray in the film. The only female character was somebody to root for was Aunt Emma (Joanna Lumley) but she ain't no angel. I have to say for men at less we got a counter-protagonist fighting against the antagonist Jordan in Agent Patrick Denham (Kyle Chandler) who did wonderful in his role. He wasn't one-dimensional pencil pusher Boy Scout. He was willing to go one on one with Jordan. The movie even have a somewhat moral character in Jordan's father Max (Rob Reiner) who tries hard to get Jordan to live life the right way but always his son to make the mistakes needed to grow. I love the idea how Martin Scorsese film it with the use of wide ends slow motion and others to show the effects of the drugs or heavy party scenes. The movie really felt like it could had work in a 3D settling. I love how he aged the film for the infomercial sequence to make it look like something that came out in the 1990s. I love all the commercials footage used from Benihana to Steve Madden. The CGI in the film is a bit choppy. You can see how bad it was in the storm scenes but there is rare mistakes made this film. Great use of establish music to set the mood of the film. The humor is a hit or miss. Some of them were really just crude like the homophobic sexism and racism comments. While others were pretty clever and funny. I love all the fourth wall jokes with Jordan gives lengthy explanations of Stockbroker terminology; only to drop it midway through. I love pop culture references like Moby Dick Gordon Gekko Freaks James Bond Willy Wonka and others. The movie had a cluster F-Bomb with 544 uses of the word. Some of them seem natural; while other seem oddly place. This film has the record for the most uses of the word in a fiction film. The movie is 3 hours long with its pacing. You can't really tell with the pacing due to not a lot of slow scenes. Still there were few gags did go on way too much. You can cut the movie to 1hr and 30 minutes and get the same results. I was deeply surprised that this movie wasn't NC-17 with its strong sexual content graphic nudity drug use and language throughout and for some violence. It's one of the movies that should be. Overall: Well-made movie that was kinda offended but still watchable.,18 June 2014
Loud and Flat Failure,"De Caprio is the heart of the film a daredevil whose motivation seems to be a misguided desire to acquire as much money as possible. He lives his life as a constant dare using and abusing the investments of others gambling with his personal relationships and his own health. He constantly endangers his life and those who are closest to him. It seems like he is capable of stopping this fall but he keeps sinking and sinking. We could say he has a survivor's nature but he carries with a very intense death wish too.Usually it's easy to understand how people like him become so successful. There's gotta be a bit of charisma to their natures so that we can see how they seduce the rest of the world into following them. Unfortunately the main lead here lacks that quality and in one of the worst casting choices in recent history what we get is a man who is not full of life and youth. He himself become his own iceberg as he reveals his ""age"" early in the film and De Caprio hasn't looked that youthful in decades. This is not to say that De Caprio doesn't try but he's not a good fit for this role. About three years ago in ""The Social Network"" we could see the recklessness and drive of man who could lure you into a trap. There's no way that seems believable here especially when you see the people he surrounds himself with. His wolf can't cast a spell and he can hardly bite.Mercifully we are not treated to the hyper kinetic editing and camera work we usually encounter in Scorcese's films but he's found other ways to annoy us. He intermingles ""Infomercials"" throughout the movie as if we need reinforcement about the seductive power of his character. They are sometimes ridiculous and I doubt that is the intent. There are also liberties with the source and it's a pity because the text is a delight to read giving us the opportunity to wonder how something that is definitely based on reality can appear so unbelievable. The movie tries desperately to portray the excess and trappings of wealth but there is nothing sexy about the constant parade of prostitutes and the overuse of obscenities which occur at least every other minute. The books gives us time to breathe. Nothing like that is ever possible here and that's why the film feels flat not necessarily boring but it fails to crackle because it's just too much of the same never showing us where all the madness originates. There's little fire just an endless portrayal of stupidity.Not all is lost (like in that other film) because we have a rising star here. Margot Robbie makes quite an entrance and gives the best and most solid performance here enhanced by the mess the rest of the cast comes up with. She's a formidable beauty with lots of ambition an overpowering stare that will let you see that she is not afraid to seek ambition but she is still a full human being capable of distinguishing between right and wrong. She reminds you of a more powerful Sharon Stone in her earlier films and she is as talented as she is gorgeous. Here we see how one person can become obsessed with another but it also makes you wonder why anyone would even stray from such a beauty. Oh yes I forgot it's perfectly obvious drugs can totally ruin your life and turn you into a monster.The film is way too long with more than a dozen scenes that could have been eliminated because they don't add anything to the story flow. We wish we could see more of the FBI agents and it would be helpful to see why Wolf doesn't seem to find any way to listen to his father a wonderful and underused Reiner.We can guess the film's ending from its early frames. It seems as if all the energy goes into the presentation of the material and little consideration is giving to the dialogue other than peppering the conversations with redundant expletives. Parading naked people around having snorting line after line of that white powder or coming up with sound blasting songs to underscore a point is a brutal point to deliver a message. Just recently the Coens gives us a more dimensional creation with no more than a few ungrateful remarks here and there. All the time I could only wonder how it was that this film escaped the stamping of that NC 17 rating because its only success was the abuse of visual imagery and irritating language that loses its impact as it appears in an endless barrage of mind numbing utterances.",25 December 2013
A very well made movie of a terrible group of stock traders.,"There are many noteworthy days in the history of Wall Street and the stock market and the one featured here is ""Black Monday"" October 19 1987 when the market dropped about 1/3rd. Jordan Belfort was a young man of about 25 had just started a new job on Wall Street and this event put him out of work. It turned out to be the catalyst for the subject of this movie.Belfort found a job as a trader with a motley band of guys who focused on so-called ""penny stocks"" very small mostly unknown companies selling for generally less than one dollar per share often for only a few cents. He was puzzled why worry about these. Because he learned the commission was great 50% of the sales total and getting a few investors to buy $5000 to $10000 worth would generate a very handsome income. Plus the operation of such trading was scarcely regulated if at all in the 1980s.So filled with the euphoria of big profits Belfort rented a garage and started his own trading company with his own motley crew and trained them well. But what they did was illegal where a large number of traders each buy parcels of a penny stock to drive up the price then dumping them. They get the profits from both hefty commission and artificially inflated stock prices while the investors get taken. This and other irregularities resulted in Belfort being convicted and sent to prison but his term was shortened by his cooperation with the FBI. So this movie is about those 6 or 7 years where he was expanding his trading operation making himself and his traders wealthy by playing very loose with the rules. And living immersed deeply in the drug and sex culture. It mostly comes across as a dark comedy.Belfort himself says the drugs and sex shown in the movie including sex parties at work or on the yacht and the pervasive foul language are not exaggerated at all. Maybe so but to me it was way overdone for what turns out to be a mainstream movie with an A-list director. I am all for accuracy but it would have been a much better movie if they had moderated the filth quite a bit. That part disappointed me that Hollywood continues to get so raw and less entertaining. Leonardo DiCaprio is really good as Jordan Belfort arguably his best performance so far and to me he deserved the Oscar for best actor. Also superb is Jonah Hill as his foul buddy Donnie Azoff. Margot Robbie is lovely as his second wife Naomi. And also superb is the actual Oscar winner in another movie Matthew McConaughey as Mark Hanna Belfort's early boss who explains to him what the trading business is really all about they don't care about the clients and whether they make money on investments. The traders get commission their job is to keep the buying and selling going.Although this is based on a real person and his own story many of the characters and events are fictional.",4 May 2014
Flashy but shallow,The Wolf of Wall Street is not a bad flick but suffers from an over-abundance of narration. Some will like that some won't. Di Caprio is very good as are his supporting cast. The direction is good the script is snappy and the audience is blind.The excess of narration generally doesn't work for me. Some on this site claim it should get an Oscar (and maybe it will in some category) but it's not good enough for Best Picture or Best Director.Jordan Belfort stole millions ruined lives and despite this Scorsese prefers to celebrate him. It's one thing to praise a fictional character's bad deeds but given the devastating recent global financial crises (which was itself just another con) I'm surprised that audiences are lapping this up. Actually maybe I'm not so surprised since the cult of money counts even average audiences amongst it's believers.Despite the film's good points I struggled to really enjoy it given that everything it preaches is the antithesis of morality. Now don't get me wrong I've watched and enjoyed my fair share of amoral (and immoral) films but the whole GFC just makes me mad as it should any rational human being. It was simply stealing money from people who can't afford it. There were no redeeming features about it and this film chooses to celebrate that.If you don't care about all that I'm sure you'll enjoy the film (and it is enjoyable). If you have a conscience you might not be taken in so much by it's worship of money.,22 January 2014
Other people's money. High life of a stockbroker.,Martin Scorcese magnificently directs this wild funny and somewhat repugnant story based on Jordon Belfort's own tome. A bit long but it is the most interesting and fast moving three hours you'll spend. An outstanding cast surrounding Leonardo DiCaprio as Belfort a Long Island stockbroker that masterminded a massive securities fraud in the 1990s. This film depicts Belfort being a self-made man; albeit through partying hard self over-medicating no holds barred debauchery leading to his whirlwind approach leaving a mark on Wall Street. Belfort's charisma being able to attract followers in sharing his use of other people's hard earned money to live a life of beautiful women exotic drugs lavish homes and cars and the utmost luxury making for a lush life. A master at scamming so well he is a loud flaunting target for the FBI. It gets hard snitching on your closest friends But Belfort manages to use the chance to garner a smaller stint in prison...36 months.Leave the kids at home because THE WOLF OF WALL STREET is forewarned a deservedly hard R due to strong sexual content blatant drug use language violence and very graphic nudity. A strong supporting cast featuring: Jonah Hill Margot Robbie Rob Reiner Kyle Chandler Jon Bernthal and Matthew McConaughey.,26 March 2014

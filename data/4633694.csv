Fantastic...but possibly overwhelming.,"""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse"" is a fantastic film but might be a bit overwhelming for some viewers. It's filled with blaring hip-hop music and the animation is beyond splashy...it's competely intense! Now these are NOT criticisms...more a warning if you hate these sorts of things or if you or someone you loves has challenges such as Autism....as the film might really be overwhelming. Still I'm nearly 55 and loved the picture...and I think most will if they have an open mind and want something different. That DOES strongly apply to me as I've gotten sick of superhero movies because there have been so many recently and there's a certain sameness about them...but not this Spider-Man film!The story is told with breathtaking CGI--with a look that is nothing like any other film I've ever seen. In this world is a young man who sees Spider-Man killed and is also bitten by a spider and becomes the next incarnation of Spider-Man. But instead of taking the time to enjoy and learn about his new powers this young man finds himself in the middle of a weird apocalyptic occurance---and all the various incarnations from the various universes come together to save the day.Overall amazingly creative...there's nothing else like it. This is more than reason enough to see it. Sadly however the film loses a bit on home TVs...even big ones as the scale and size of the film needs the big screen.",26 March 2019
So Much More Than I Expected!,"So many have commented so I will be brief. From an intriguing plot to wonderful characterizations using drop dead animation this film works. About ten minutes into it it thought ""This is just a kind of hip hop version of Spiderman."" But the main character is suddenly thrust into a world which he must learn quickly to manage. The canon takes a turn here toward incredible creativity. I avoid mainstream animation but this has restored my faith.",19 November 2019
How on God's green Earth did this work so well???,"The worlds of superhero movies and superhero comics are not as similar as they seem on the surface. Currently film studios are all about the ""extended universe"" seeing how many different titles and characters they can shove into one franchise (Avengers X-Men Justice League) making for an easy way to squeeze a few extra bucks out of their lesser known properties. Comics have this as well of course. However they also have something modern movies haven't really tapped into yet: story one-offs a chance for a storyteller to create a unique tale and not be constrained by the implications on or from the larger universe. Spider-Verse gets to do just that while playfully taking on the fun (if convoluted) absurdity of extended superhero universes. Listen I hear you. ""How could we possibly need another Spider-Man movie?"" Spider-Verse understands that question and has a take on it. Yes Peter Parker is here. In fact there are two Peter Parkers. There's also a Spider-Woman a Noir Spider-Man an anime Spider-Girl/Robot and a Spider-Pig. At the center though is Miles Morales an Afro-Hispanic Brooklyn teen who must help these other Spider-People get back to their own planes of existence. He fights with his cop dad he adores his shady uncle hates being simply the smartest kid in the room and just wants to do something that matters. Being Spider-Man wasn't his idea but hey when a radioactive spider gives you powers what choice do you have? Look I don't have any sort of hot take on this movie. It looks great the humor pops with surprises the voice casting is beyond perfect. It's simply a stylishly exciting and refreshingly unique take on the superhero genre and sometimes that's more than enough.",21 December 2018
Stan Lee Is Smiling Right Now,A movie worthy of Stan Lee's approval. Incredible animation great story great message. This film lives up to the hype and honestly surpassed my expectations. The only reason I think there are some negative reviews is because you can never please everyone. However for the vast majority of viewers I believe you'll find this film to be great. Highly recommend seeing it in theaters just for the amazing animation style.,17 December 2018
Game Changer,Have you ever sat through a film and you knew that films would never be the same going forward? For example Terminator 2 Star Wars.. the first Toy Story... Iron ManWell this is one of those. This is a almost rather perfect film. Let me just say the the stylished animation is just top notch. It as if the comic book leaped off the pages. I've seen practically all super hero films to include the DC animated ones. This feels as if they took comic books and Playstation animation and just came up with this perfect look.And the story is great.. the pacing is so wonderful. It is able to tell the story.. and an origin without boring us to tears like Zack Snyder has done in the DC universe. The story is quiet touching. And it allows us to have a pretty interesting Spider Man in Miles WITHOUT thrashing or having a Peter Parker like experience.Plus our the villains are so well done..But I think we will see a lot more of this type of animation in the future from Sony. I think they announced their presence with authority.. like how Dreamworks did with Shrek.. and how Pixar did.It's been awhile I seen something so unexpected and so cool.,21 December 2018
The best comic book movie I've ever seen,The thing I hate about superhero movies is the origin story. After a multitude of Spider-Man stories do we really need another retelling of his origin? That's the first - of many - things that Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse does right. Much like how Grant Morrison retold Superman's beginnings in one page in All-Star Superman this movie tells you everything you need to know within one minute and goes right into the action. It expects you to know the expected but then once it makes you feel comfortable it tears the rug out from under you.Here's the low down for those of you that don't read comics: there's more than one reality and more than one version of Spider-Man who may not always be a man. Written by Phil Lord and Christopher Miller who left Solo due to creative differences this movie is pure joy from start to finish. If you know and love the characters it's so amazing to see them treated properly on the big screen. And if you don't it's so much fun to meet all new versions of a character you already love.Beyond the Spidey you know and love there's Miles Morales a gifted teen who struggles to fit into a new school. He loves Spider-Man is often at odds with his parents and looks up to his uncle Aaron. While working on graffiti he's bit by a radioactive spider and suddenly has the same abilities as his hero.After a tragic incident when the real Spidey battles the Kingpin as that baddy tries to uses a particle accelerator to bring back his lost wife and son Miles must take on the mantle of a hero while working alongside the Spiders of other dimensions: Spider-Gwen Spider-Man Noir Peter Porker the Spectacular Spider-Ham and Peni Parker and SP//dr.The voice talent in this movie is absolutely amazing: Lily Tomlin is the best Aunt May ever Nicholas Cage steals the show as Spider-Man Noir who is from a world where it's always black and white and smells like rain and it was great to hear comedian John Mulaney as Spider-Ham.There's so much of this movie that perfectly translates the language of comics in a way that few films have succeeded in accomplishing. Ang Lee's The Hulk came close but the animated styles of this film are constantly moving and even more alive than real action.It's also the first time I've seen a teenage world in a superhero movie that feels vibrant and now. Nothing feels fake phony or forced about the school scenes. And the music is just as powerful as the film.Of all the Stan Lee cameos in the Marvel films the one here feels the most organic and perfect. It brought a tear to my eye when he sold Miles the costume and told him that all the costumes eventually fit. Kudos to the producers for remembering both Lee and Steve Ditko at the film's end.In case you didn't pick it up I give this movie my highest recommendation. While Infinity War may be the best Marvel movie ever you need to have seen every single Marvel movie ever to get that. This is the kind of film that Becca could watch and enjoy without needing to open a single comic which is just how she likes it. It's not only the best animated movie I've seen this year it may be the best movie overall.,26 December 2018
the most visually stunning film I've ever seen,There's hardly anything I would improve about this film. The visuals concepts soundtrack characters pace humor and animation are all some of the best I've ever seen in any film; I was worried the hype would ruin it for me as it always does but not even the group of kids in the theater who wouldn't stop loudly talking could ruin it for me. It is visually engaging and beautiful in every scene not to mention with an incredibly unique art style and is honestly something other animated movies should have to look up to for a long time. The only real issue I can think of is the flashing lights which really alienates any epileptic audience but even then it's done so in a beautiful and artful way.,20 December 2018
A Spidey Movie That Works In Multiple Dimensions,Visually stunning. Great storyline. Great cast. Amazing soundtrack. Tear jerking cameo. Pop culture post credit scene of the decade. Thank you Marvel and Sony for making a Spidey movie everyone can love.,14 December 2018
The better the art the harder it is to find the right words to describe it.,"Updated review 4-9-19I've now watched this movie 10 times since getting it on digital and then Blu-ray and can safely say this is a rare near perfect movie. This is of course my opinion and I understand why this movie isn't for everyone. Let's break down a few of the reasons why for each of these points.If we had a list of everything that can be done to make a near perfect movie this movie checks every box. The visuals have been talked about endlessly. It won an Oscar for them. We know they're great.The story is great giving us a new Spider-Man with his own skills and personality that he brings to the table. The script is tight and the production is executed with laser precision.The voice acting is nothing short of top notch. This is easily the second best thing about this movie right behind the glorious visuals.Shamiek Moore has quickly grown on me over the ten times I've watched this movie. His range is as good as any veteran actor and he injects so much life into Miles Morales. He IS Miles Morales.Chris Pine did not phone in the short amount of lines he had whatsoever. Just superb casting because he and Jake Johnson sound pretty similar. And oh boy Jake Johnson.I never understood why JJ had gotten so wildly popular over the last several years. With this movie I finally understand. I get it. It clicked. From the moment he pops up in this movie around the 20 minute mark till the end Jake turns in one of the voice acting performances perhaps of all time. He succeeds in bringing a past his prime Peter Parker to life and runs the gamut of dramatic sincere intense but above all FUNNY. Every single comedic line never fails to make me laugh out loud. Many of the gags pop into my head while I'm working or doing something else and I'll chuckle and repeat the line to myself.I've always enjoyed Hailee Steinfeld and she shines in this movie along with all the supporting cast.The greatest thing about this movie also happens to be its weakness. For me the visuals are second to none. Another review title summed it up perfectly. ""The most visually stunning movie I've ever seen"". Absolutely agree. And while it takes a little time - usually 10-15 minutes - for your eyes to adjust to the frame rate some people apparently can not adjust to this. I can imagine how poor that viewing experience would be too bad really. Another thing is since they didn't use actual motion blur but instead chose to animate blur-like artifacts and tricks to make it seem like blur or having images doubled and overlapped for a ghosting effect it confuses some people into thinking they're seeing the 2 images of the 3D version without the glasses. And lastly the sheer intensity of some of the rapid action sequences combined with visual aesthetic pushed just beyond the breaking point and then dialed ever so slightly back by the direction team it's just simply too much for some people. I get that.As far as continuity/plot holes and things of that nature I think the movie could actually stand to be about 15-20 minutes longer. There really aren't many issues though so maybe this is just me being greedy for more visuals.Original review: Sure we can dissect and critique and praise using any number of words we choose but in the end to actually appreciate truly great art it simply must be experienced in the medium in which it was created. For this movie it was lovingly crafted in 3D and so in my opinion can only be fully realized by the viewer in 3D.What is a comic book movie and what makes it great? From the original Superman where we first saw a comic book hero fly to Burton's dark and stylized Batman to the graphic novel style Sin City live action ensemble X-MEN Spider-Man Iron-Man The Dark Knight the entire MCU....all of these are comic book movies and depending on your personal definition probably range from good to great. And they're all live action with varying degrees of special effects and some with animation. If you had to pick ones that 'feel the most like a comic book' you'd probably pick Sin City for the overall look and the phase 3 MCU films for a combination of visuals and capturing the tone and spirit of the comic book story arcs.But they aren't literally animated comics. The closest to that would probably be the animated movies right? Like Mask of the Phantasm or any number of the Marvel animated movies. But again those are really 'just cartoons' and I don't mean that in a bad way. They're simply cartoon versions of comic books.Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse is quite literally an animated comic book and yet it is so much more at the same time. It's an explosion of comic book ink and paper a dizzying palette of superbly rich colors a jaw dropping display of digital artistry melded with living breathing characters we care about a story that is perfectly derived from the very medium in which it is being created and yet not for one single moment ever feels forced or hollow a soundtrack fused with an endless exploration of a massive city staggeringly sized scientific chambers gigantic forests and neon-electric-digital-dreamscapes of action set pieces that whir and click and come to life exactly as they do in the minds of children reading them on paper.This movie is breathtakingly good in every aspect. Like-I'm-questioning-my-sanity-is-it-really-as-good-as-I-think-it-is!?!? Yes. Yes yes yes.Remember the old Sega game Comix Zone? And how it was like ""oh wow! It's a comic book come to life!""? This is like that with modern technology cranked up a thousand times.But here's the most important part - *it was all done in the right way by the right people at the right time*. It feels like this project was greenlit and handed to the very people who created comic books themselves with a ""here ya go you have full creative control. Oh and by the way you have an unlimited budget! And resources! Have as much fun making a great movie as you possibly can!""My first job was working in a movie theater. I took full advantage of being able to see free movies. I've built a decent surround sound system with all the creature comforts and have a growing library of movies. From the re-release of the original Star Wars trilogy to each of the prequels and to the ongoing trilogy today T-2 Titanic the original X-Men Avatar The Dark Knight Avengers Avengers: Infinity War and so many more...I've gone to many many big movie theater events for the experience. And I can safely say hands down that Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse in 3D is the best moviegoing experience I have ever had. It's that great.",21 December 2018
Captures Your Attention From The Get Go!,What would you do if you could be a superhero? What if you have no choice? From the very beginning Spider-Man: Into the Spicer-Verse is very energetic and captures your attention. This animated film has impressive visuals. The music creates a fantastic rhythm. And you just want to watch more.The story follows a high school student named Miles Morales who just changed school. He goes into an abandoned subway station with his uncle Erin and gets bitten by a radioactive spider. Ever since that day Miles starts sticking to everything he touches. Then he meets Spider-Man (Peter Parker) teams up with some friends from the same dimension and they attempt to save the world from the villain Kingoin.The story is very original and makes the impossible possible. It takes all the abilities of Spider-Man to far and beyond with its action scenes. The film also shows a very real family atmosphere and the humor is smart. I love the non-traditional characters and how they embrace diversity. And yes! Spider-Man is Latino and surely does speak Spanish! There are also some fun new characters.With this film Marvel has created a film that celebrates comics film and visual arts. Of course it celebrates Spider-Man and makes this super hero relevant and contemporary. It is absolutely eye-poppingly beautiful and really pushes the boundaries of the genre with its colors textures and camera movements. There are several different forms of animation in one film. You feel as if you are actually reading a comic book or the comic book is coming to life.Naturally the film does a very touching tribute to genius Stan Lee. I feel the filmmakers took some risks bringing new ideas to this iconic character which as been adored for over 50 years. The result is a must-see family movie that is even more appealing to new generations. I also love how this film is animated. It's so different. I've never seen a film like this one. I think it's very unique. Be sure to stay after the credits to see something very special including another set of credits at the very end.This film sets a new era in animated movies. I recommend it for ages 5 to 18 as well as adults. I give it 5 out of 5 stars and include it in my Oscar predictions as a very possible winner. This is the film parents will love their kids to watch and kids will enjoy in many different ways.With great power comes great responsibility and we all can be heroes. This is the idea behind Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse - inclusion for all in the vast universe and the idea that we can all be heroes by making the right choices and doing our best helping each other in our everyday life.Reviewed by Zoe C.

Visually innovative but has a lack of focus and is overstuffed.,"As much as I enjoy this movie (and as an animator/storyartist I love the visuals!) I have to honest and say it is a bit of an unfocused mess. The reason why you should see this movie is because it is the first in what will hopefully be a trend of innovative and creative animated movies that aren't just looking over the shoulders of what Disney and Pixar are doing. This movie is its own creature and I think it deserves to be seen just for the visuals and the opportunity to hopefully support this trend...However I would only say that if the movie has some substance to it.... which it does. I recommend people see this movie but it should be noted that I think this movie may be getting the ""Kubo"" treatment where an animated film is visually impressive to such a degree that people gloss over bad writing because everything they are looking at is so cool.The first half of this movie is brilliant. I think just about everything in the first half works really well and is super effective. Miles Morales felt like a real kid with some real kid issues Peter B Parker was funny tragic and fleshed out and Gwen... existed (we'll get to her later). My eyes were glued to the screen and I was excited for where the story would go as I was genuinely surprised at a couple twists and turns in the story.Then a certain moment happened in the movie where I was taken out of the film and went ""Wait... oh shoot this is going downhill real fast."" It was the introduction of all of the other spider-verse characters. At that moment the film shifted gears into an entirely different film from the first half. Does Miles Morales fit in with the professionals? Can Miles Morales impress them? Everyone seems to hate him due to his lack of experience! Can Miles Morales take a leap of faith (which he already did in the beginning of the movie)??!?! Is Miles Morales even relevant to the story?!?!?!?! All of these sudden new themes and plot developments completely derail what the first half of the film was setting up to such a degree that it felt like a giant schism cut through the film and the second half of the film was waving goodbye to the first half.I'll be clear that I have no issue with other spider-verse characters sharing screen-time in the film the issue is that they don't add much in terms of character development or interaction with Miles. The characters should serve to help Miles grow but in this movie they just seem like another pair of fists to punch bad guys and there is no better example of this than...Gwen Stacey.Gwen Stacey has the unfortunate issue of being completely irrelevant to the story when she should be an important and vital character to Peter B Parker's/Miles Morales' character growth and should have an arc of her own. This is a character who witnessed Peter Parker (her best friend) die and Peter B Parker is someone who witnessed Gwen Stacey die in her universe! WHY DON'T THEY DISCUSS THIS!!! Peter B Parker should be surprised and excited to see someone he knew as dead alive again and she should be happy to see her best friend once more! Instead the two characters just... punch bad guys... like everyone else. No growth or development between the two.To make matters worse Gwen doesn't even really work to help Miles Morales develop as a character. In the beginning of the film she is built up to be one of the main characters but in the second half she doesn't develop any further than she did in the beginning. She experiences no character growth nor does she help develop any other characters. She just exists in the film.I could go on for a while about all of the different weird pacing issues in the second half of the film such as Miles Morales suddenly getting super powerful and skilled out of nowhere (it's odd that people complain about ""Mary Sues"" in film but don't complain about Miles Morales going from zero to hero in one scene) or a single cut from a comedy scene to a tragic ""friends splitting up"" scene some loose character threads such as Miles' dad telling cops to chase spider-man but we never see them do it and many other instances of odd pacing choices and poor juxtapositions of emotional story beats.But I will end this on a positive note: All of the characters are enjoyable when they get their moment and I think the writing on the father was really good. He wasn't your typical ""larger than life"" father but a very honest strong but stubborn dad who has his flaws yet is very likable and reasonable. I wish him and Uncle Aaron had some scenes together and their dynamic was a bit more fleshed out but as is I still like them regardless of the additional scenes they deserved.Go see it if you want to support innovative and risky animation but be warned that it is not a perfect film (other than visually).",4 January 2019
Creative funny engaging and exciting,"There was a lot of hype about this film which surprised me because when I first glanced at the trailer I just dismissed what I saw as a direct-to-TV film. The hype gave me pause but at the same time made me wait so that it had time to settle into reality. Coming to it outside of the hype and awards I was open to what to expect and was pleasantly surprised. What pleased me was how creative it was in several areas of production. In terms of narrative it took the risk to be silly with its alternative Spider-Men but was able to balance that with an engaging and reasonably serious core narrative. It managed to be funny fun engaging and enjoyable all the way through.Animation wise it mixed many styles and approaches very well. Even when it felt OTT with the visuals it still somehow worked and I didn't feel beaten down or tired as sometimes can happen with visual overload. The overall design of the film added to this with good use of music shot framing and animation to make it feel very cool and fluid throughout. Production-wise it felt like it ""got"" the sense of humour of the script and made that work more than it otherwise would have done. Voice performances also seem to get this and everyone plays their characters well.Overall it is creative funny engaging and exciting for those that get into it and accept it on its own terms.",22 September 2019
Giving Infinity war a run for it's money,This movie was absolutely incredible. From the animation to the storytelling to the characters this movie is completely one of a kind. It is easily the best looking animated movie of the year (no surprise there) but what really caught me off guard was the story they were able to tell in such a short amount of time. Each character has their own distinct personality and is given their own separate characterization without making the movie feel bloated. I knew I would end up liking this movie but this movie has completely exceeded my expectations. If you enjoy superheros or animation you should 100% definitely watch it in a theater.,15 December 2018
Pch ching,A teenager finds his body changing and realises he can shoot sticky white substances from his body.,6 August 2021
For such an inventive premise and excellent animation questionable plot choices are made and the themes and arc are surprisingly formulaic,"I think this one is mostly ""on me"" as someone who never read comic books growing up and enjoys the ideas that movies leave me with not the visual experience as much. Spider-Verse is undeniably creative and unique particularly in its animation which I think is the best I've ever seen and the premise is a self-aware and original breath of fresh air in the superhero genre. The voice acting is good and the comedy is pretty good (though I found the jokes revolving around Miles being young and being goofy in learning his powers to be trite and overplayed). While I was ready to love it many plot points left me scratching my head and there was no sense of any real stakes. Among the frustrating plot points to me were the absurdity of the 3 new spider people especially Porky (why? How does that make any sense?); the uncle coincidentally being the person working for Kingpin and tasked with chasing down Spider-Man; Kingpin's backstory scene where we are following Miles escaping and out of nowhere cut to a memory of Kingpin's family dying after having no background on him at all just felt very out of place and poorly edited; and other minor points. The story was quite predictable and followed a rote story arc which contributed significantly to the sense that the outcome was never in doubt keeping my emotional investment and engagement low throughout. In classic deus ex machina form Miles struggled and gradually is improving in using his powers and then right after his dad talks to him he magically has complete control and can win all the fights is a beast out of nowhere? It had done such a good job of showing his struggles in being valued and succeeding in his tasks so the flipped switch of him effortlessly and suddenly being powerful was a disservice to the rest of the movie. Thematically it didn't feel like anything unique as a standard coming of age story and with a message that anyone can be a superhero. It pays obvious and honest homage to the comic book form more genuinely adapting the style than any movie I've seen before. It did many things really well but the various plot point frustrations and the lack of emotional investment due to the lack of stakes made it a forgettable if pleasant movie experience for me. I certainly recommend it to others as at minimum you'll get a fun amusing and visually gorgeous movie and if you like the comic book style it could be an all time great.",6 April 2019
The Best Spider-Man movie ever!,Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse is one of the most beautiful animated movies I've seen and possibly the best looking superhero movie of all time; with its bright neon colors combined with its comic book asthetic it creates a world unlike anything I've seen since the LEGO Movie. The characters are all great. Miles Morales is a fantastic protagonist; understandably scared at the prospect of being Spider-Man but excited to learn. His relationship with his father and Peter Parker are some of the most emotiinal scenes in the movie. Gwen Stacy is also a great supporting character as are thr rest of the spider people. The villains are fun and the action is jaw dropping. It's also tear jerking tribute to Stan Lee. This is the best Spider-Man movie by far.,21 December 2018
A little overrated but still good.,Didn't find the graphics that appealing and the story was ok but nothing spectacular. I'm guessing anyone into anime or young kids would've enjoyed this more than teens and older viewers. 7/10 from me,13 March 2019
What's better than one Spidey? Six Spideys of course!,Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse tells the story of Miles Morales(Shameik Moore). When Miles becomes the Spider-Man of his universe he meets various versions of the wall-crawler from parallel universes. Now all the Spideys must team up to put an end to a danger that could alter reality in terrible ways.Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse is a mind-blowing film. Directors Bob Persichetti Peter Ramsey Rodney Rothman & writer Phil Lord have given us the best big screen adaptation of Spider-Man & that's saying something. I love the fact that this movie makes us feel nostalgic about the previous big screen adaptations of Spider-Man. The animation is awe-inspiring. The comic book format of the animation is unique & is perfect for one of the most loved comic book characters. The 3D is amazing(watch this film on the biggest screen possible preferably IMAX). The action set pieces the humour & the emotional scenes are perfectly balanced throughout. The voice-over work is unforgettable. Shameik Moore is spectacular as Miles Morales. Moore brings that much needed vulnerability to his character. Jake Johnson is outstanding as Peter B. Parker. Hailee Steinfeld is brilliant as Gwen Stacy. Mahershala Ali is perfect as Uncle Aaron. Brian Tyree Henry is excellent as Jefferson Davis. John Mulaney Kimiko Glenn & Nicolas Cage are awesome as Spider-Ham Peni Parker & Spider-Man Noir respectively. Kathryn Hahn & Liev Schreiber are superb as Doc Ock & Wilson Fisk respectively. Lily Tomlin Luna Lauren Velez Zoe Kravitz & Chris Pine are great as Aunt May Rio Morales Mary Jane & Peter Parker respectively. Everything about Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse is jaw-dropping! A must watch. Swing by your nearest multiplex immediately!,16 December 2018
Visually Beautiful but the Good Part of the Story is in Another Dimension,It started of well and I knew by the trailer what I was going to expect. I was waiting for something beyond my expectation but when it became weirder it definitely became a lot weirder. If you have seen episodes of The Flash this film's story feels like meh. Apart from the dialogues it's definitely bad writing. The main character is completely clueless about being spider-man but when the writers need him to use his skills voila! he knows it all like the back of his hand.People who say this is the most visually stunning film they have ever seen are those who haven't seen films. All those who have given this a rating standing at 8 point something have been blown over the visuals of this film which is great but every film's basic foot lies in it's screenplay. This is sloppy writing. Aunt May being kind of Iron Man and all. There is a moment in every new super hero film where the hero falls short of confidence and then a few scenes or a lot of scenes later the confidence is regained. Here it happens in the very next scene. What a load of BS. Spider-man sticky web sticks to his hand easily and is a disturbance for him but it is conveniently easy for the villain to break that sticky webAnd Nicoles Cage..Are you kidding me...His way of talking makes it irritatingly meme funny. Depressing. His character was a complete waste.But definitely much better than Captain Marvel. This film is visually stunning and the animation is excellent. Kudos to the animation artists. But the writers need to write better.,15 March 2019
This movie is not over hyped!,Going into this I had high hopes but was afraid It might not be as good as the hype says But damn... This movie is underhyped. I loved every second of it. The animation was gorgeous the characters were so fun and the soundtrack flawless. The twists you never see coming and don't even get me started on how beautiful the end fight scene was. This film is the best animated film of 2018 and in my opinion the best film of 2018 definitely worth seeing!,15 December 2018
Out of This Dimension Good! 100/10 off the Charts!,I knew that this movie would be good from the first moment I heard about it last year and it did not disappoint me one bit. It met all of my expectations and then went above and beyond them. The animation is a blend of CGI stop animation pop/comic book art and realism. The vibrant colors pop out at you and the action sequences really enthrall. A very captivating and beautiful piece of art is this movie and the writing choices leave nothing to be desired. The story is that of the traditional starting superhero with a bunch of twists thrown in. The movie itself actually follows past comics for the most part with some minor changes here and there. A true Spider-Man or comic book fan in general will not have anything to criticize in this movie. Everything that fans want to see out of Spidey(s) is in this movie. There are multiple different variations of Spider-Man in the film and all of them have their special moments to shine. The end credit scene just rockets this movie up past my already positive expectations and it gets a 10/10 from me! The movie can be enjoyed by both young and old alike and trust me it will blow your mind! Best animated film of 2018 and one of the best superhero movies ever made. It deserves any and all awards and kudos it will surely garner.,15 December 2018
Come on give this a chance,Amazing movie. Great animation the best Spider-Man movie in my opinion,20 December 2018
"""What would I do if I were me?""","Uh-oh I feel a 'here I go again' coming. As I write this ""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse"" is ranked #29 on IMDb's list of Top 250 movies of all time right there in between ""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""Léon: The Professional"". Among the eighty plus comic-book based super-hero movies I've seen and reviewed it comes in at #2 right behind ""The Dark Knight"" which means viewers give it a higher rating than ""Avengers: Infinity War"" and ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" if any of you Marvel fans care about that. I don't know I just think there's just something askew about that instinctively telling me that in this case it's not the quality of the movie that places it so high in the rankings but the overall popularity and buzz that attaches itself to the film. But enough of that.I actually thought the film was OK not great but OK. As far as animated movies go I thought it was exceptionally rendered with bright vivid colors and an interesting cast of characters some of whom I was familiar with and others not. I actually do remember Spider-Ham from the dark recesses of my memory long ago. As far as the story line goes it wasn't particularly new or innovative how many threats to reality have you encountered over the course of your movie viewing lives? If it sounds like I'm trashing the flick I'm not really I think it's great for kids and fans of animated movies. Speaking of which and relative to my argument above the picture is outranked by the Japanese anime ""Spirited Away"" on the current Top 250 at Number #27 so I'm not bashing the picture for not being live action.My biggest kick out of watching the movie and I make this statement a lot about Marvel based comic book movies was seeing writer and artist Stan Lee drawn into the film as a store clerk named appropriately enough 'Stan'. With his recent passing at the age of ninety five it saddens me to know that I won't be seeing him in those ubiquitous cameo spots that I always look for in a Marvel super-hero film. As one of the original creators of Spider-Man along with Steve Ditko (who also passed away in 2018) I'd like to think that Stan Lee got his own special preview showing of ""Into the Spider-Verse"" before he entered Valhalla. He is one that will be missed.",2 January 2019

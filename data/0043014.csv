A true Hollywood horror story,"Hack screenwriter Joe Gillis (William Holden) accidentally falls in with faded screen legend Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson). She lives in a crumbling old mansion with her butler Max (Erich von Stroheim). She refuses to believe that she's no longer remembered and will never make another movie. She gets Gillis to stay with her and rewrite ""Salome"" which she thinks will be her comeback. Gillis has no other choice and things slowly get out of hand.A VERY cynical view of Hollywood--especially for 1950. It shows what Hollywood does to people like Norma--it makes them stars tells them that they're great and dump them coldly when they're no longer needed. It also takes swipes at directors agents screenwriters even entire studios! It has a tight quick script is appropriately filmed in gloomy black and white and is masterfully directed by Billy Wilder. Everybody thought this was a bad idea when it was being made. It was believed to be too cold and vicious for the public. Also Holden was warned it would ruin his career by playing a younger man kept by an older woman. But it turned out great and is now rightfully considered a classic.The acting is almost all good. I never thought Nancy Olson was that good. Her character is too pure and sweet to be believable. Everybody else is right on target though. Holden is just great in his role. You see the pity anger and helplessness on his face when he realizes Norma is falling in love with him--and he's trapped. von Stroheim was equally good as Max who encourages Norma's delusions. Swanson however is just magnificent! She has a very showy role and could have overplayed it--but she doesn't. She's mad for sure--but you only see it peeking through every once in a while. When she loses it completely at the end it's frightening. If she had played it like that all through the movie it never would have worked. How she lost the Oscar that year to Judy Holliday for ""Born Yesterday"" is beyond me. This is a must see and a true Hollywood classic but VERY cold and cynical. A 10 all the way.""I am big--it's the pictures that got small"". ""All right Mr. deMille--I'm ready for my closeup"".",15 March 2008
"""Madam is the greatest star of all.""",Sunset Blvd. could be looked at as a thesis on what fame does to certain people. For Norma Desmond fame created a fantasy world that forever trapped her. Living alone in that giant house on Sunset save for her servant Max Norma whiles away the hours planning her magnificent return. Her fame kept alive by fan letters and her hope of return kindled by Joe Gillis. For Norma there is no other life than standing before cameras and acting out lives of characters that are larger than life. Of course no one knows who Norma Desmond is. Gloria Swanson gives a magnificent performance. She runs from melancholy to unbridled joy to complete mental breakdown. William Holden is the ultimate cynic. He plays Norma like a fiddle but gets ensnared in her web of decaying glory. In the end Joe pays the price for enduring Norma's insanity. As she descends that staircase in the final scene you can see that she is completely lost in her own world. A world where no one grows old where she is forever young and where she is the greatest star of them all. After all stars never age.,4 August 1999
Best Performance in Film History: Gloria Swanson,"The plot has been discussed at length in other comments.To me SUNSET BOULEVARD has it all. The comedy is sly the drama is of epic proportions because it's not JUST a story about Hollywood or an aging actress. It's really about the giving up of dreams.Norma's dream of return held to for 20 years is ironic because Norma so closely parallels Gloria. That Norma cannot make a comeback in 1950 even with connections to DeMille is sad. The sadness is due to Norma's refusal to accept her aging or the politics of Hollywood that worship youth. It's ironic that Norma has no place in Hollywood (the parade has passed by) but DeMille is still working and in the scenes from Samson and Delilah we spot other old-timers like Henry Wilcoxon and Julia Faye--still working but not as STARS. The final irony here is that Gloria did make the comeback that Norma couldn't make.Norma has a thing about STARS.... she says at one point... ""the stars are ageless."" Well this is true in a filmic sense. I can still watch Gloria Swanson in THE LOVE OF SUNYA or MANHANDLED and yup she is ageless. She is still twenty something. That screen image is forever held up like a bad mirror to the reality of being 50. On another occasion Norma says ""nobody leaves a STAR that's what makes one a STAR."" True again but it's not just Gillis who is leaving Norma her fans have already left. Hence if one is left one cannot be a STAR.Gillis also gives up his dream (temporarily) of being a writer Max gives up his dream of directing and even Betty gives up her dream of love with Gillis. Scary stuff.The film is also about LOVE. Look what these people have done for love: love of another person or love of fame or whatever. Max loves Norma. Norma loves Gillis. Gillis loves Norma and Betty. Betty loves Gillis and Artie. Artie loves Betty. And all of them love Hollywood.Everyone is crushed at the end of this film..... The scene of Max ""directing"" the scene as Norma descends the staircase is one of the all-time great scenes in a film. Norma's final speech which sums up everything (""there is nothing else"") is devastating. Can she really be insane and make this lucid speech? If she's NOT insane then she has knowingly killed Gillis to prevent his leaving her (a STAR)....... Also the shots of Max blinking away tears as Norma descends (supposedly into madness) and also of Hedda Hopper crying are equally as devastating as Norma's speech about ""being back"" and ""all those wonderful people out there in the dark"" (which of course includes us every time we watch the film).I cannot think of any other film (possibly CITIZEN KANE) that works on so many different levels. And Gloria Swanson gives the greatest performance in film history!",11 January 2006
Another Billy Wilder masterpiece,I have yet to see a Billy Wilder film that I haven't loved and Sunset Boulevard is definitely one of those films. It's interesting to watch the film during different times in one's life  when I was a child watching this film I thought the story was good and that Norma Desmond (Swanson) was a pretty scary lady. In my teens/college years I appreciated it as a certified classic and for its commentary on Hollywood. Now in my late 20's and early 30's I found it to have a different impact on me  I was saddened by Desmond's mental illness and when she makes her final descent down her staircase and utters her famous line as the camera pans the faces of the people around her so full of pity and the care her butler/ex-husband takes to make sure she's happy for maybe the last time in her life made more of an impact on me than any other time in the 20-odd times I've seen this film. There are only a small handful of central characters in Sunset Boulevard and they are so richly written that this film will remain timeless. There are not a lot of `dated' themes in this film  the circle of life that is Hollywood isn't going to be much more evolved in 2050 than it was in 1950. If you haven't seen this film watch it because there is something for just about anyone in this film.--Shelly,11 April 2004
The Hollywood Myth FOREVER Shattered !!!,"Until 1950 American films were strictly entertainment some deeper than others. Studio executives were very protective of image and star-making. In essence everything seemed perfect. Billy Wilder Charles Brackett and D.M. Marshman Jr. created a stunning work of art that splits the Hollywood sign in two and exposed a dream factory for what it really is: a struggle to both gain and keep notoriety in the limelight. ""Norma Desmond"" and ""Joe Gillis"" are at opposite ends of this warped Hollywood mindset with Gillis played by that most cynical of actors William Holden trying to pay the rent and Norma (Gloria Swanson) living a lie as a silent queen whose star burned ""10000 midnights ago"". How a picture with such a snide look at the industry could come out in 1950 is simply mind-boggling considering some of the light fodder that came out of Hollywood at the time. It has inspired many modern day disciples such as Altman's THE PLAYER and Sonnenfeld's GET SHORTY both of which took their vicious hilarious parodies to the jugular of the movie capital of the world. SUNSET BLVD is the father of all socially oriented pictures regarding the movies and is by far the best.The images of this beautiful black and white powerhouse are fascinating and unforgettable: the dead writer floating in a pool eyes wide open looking right at us at the beginning; the eerie pipe organ that plays by the breeze in the middle of one of the most deep and dustiest sets ever; the funeral ceremony of the dead monkey in Norma's courtyard (""That must have been one important chimp. The grandson of King Kong perhaps."" says Holden in a delightfully crisp and wise voice-over.) Holden pulls his car into a driveway off of the boulevard that will change his life forever. He is the emblem of the struggle to get notoriety. He has only a few B Movies to his credit. Swanson as Norma Desmond is the symbol of lost fame and has become the talk of legend. What is ironic about her character is that she may be playing herself in an odd way. She WAS an actual silent star whose career went down the tubes after the talkies came about. Her madness combined with Holden's last drop of naiveté combine to give us one of the most electrifying ""give and take"" between actors I've ever witnessed.Both lead parts were passed over by several actors. Holden was eventually forced into it as a contract player. How could you pass on such a script? Even ""wax figures"" (as Holden calls them) Buster Keaton H.B. Warner and Anna Q. Nilsson come to Norma's to play bridge of course being Hollywood outcasts themselves after the invention of sound in film. Some of the dialogue takes a swing at actual movies and people (GONE WITH THE WIND Zanuck Menjou). This must have brought the house down in Hollywood screening rooms throughout the town. Louis B. Mayer even condemned Billy Wilder for ""ruining the industry"". The film is sad and darkly humorous depicting the antics of Norma who is quite insane and Holden who is going along with what Norma is giving him but has plans of his own. Another wax figure still alive and kicking in 1950 appears as himself in an important role. Cecil B. Demille who once directed Norma/Gloria back in the silent heyday tries to set her straight telling her pictures have ""changed"". They had indeed especially after this searing comment on celebrity status. I wonder if they knew what they were creating while making this gem.Scenes are shot right on the lot of Paramount Studios (even the front gate) and Norma's mansion is an unforgettable piece of history and gloom with a floor that ""Valentino once danced on."" There is so much to discuss but little to enlighten you on how great SUNSET BLVD is without you seeing it. Just two years later films began to crop up with the same tainted view of Hollywood most with varying degrees of deception. SINGIN' IN THE RAIN one of the all-time entertainments quietly had a nasty taste in its mouth regarding celebrity and the invention of sound movies. Watch these films closely and see the skeletons of the modern Hollywood bash films.RATING: 10 of 10",22 April 1999
Something really special,Joe Gillis is floating face down in a pool and tells his story.That story tells how he met Norma Desmond a big star from the silent era who now is forgotten by the people.She's planning a major comeback with a script of Salome.She wants Joe to help her with the movie.The movie's no good everybody can see that but Joe still stays around to help her.Soon he realizes that it was a big mistake.Sunset Blvd. (1950) is a masterpiece from the master called Billy Wilder.The actors are really unique.William Holden is superb as Joe Gillis and Gloria Swanson an actual silent film star is absolutely brilliant as Norma.Erich von Stroheim does a wonderful job as Max von Mayerling and so does the beautiful Nancy Olson as Betty Schaefer.In cameos you can see people like Cecil B.DeMille and Buster Keaton.The movie is something really special from the beginning till the end.You can't see movies like this these days.Now we don't have directors like Billy Wilder to make them.In his movies everything usually worked.Especially the dialog was something you don't have so often in modern movies.What happened to the great writers? Only a few seem to exist.,1 July 2004
A popular opinion is to believe Joe is a cad BUT...,... how would you feel if the sexes of the characters were reversed? Suppose it was a woman writer trying to break into Hollywood completely broke who due to a flat tire wanders into that big mansion. Pretty much financially cornered she agrees to a job reworking some old film star's (let's say John Gilbert lived) script and comeback vehicle and slowly what independence she has is taken away - her things are moved from her apartment where she is behind on her rent into a room over the garage at the mansion her host sits by and lets her car be repossessed she is never paid the promised cash for her work a bad rainstorm moves her from her room over the garage into a room in the main house where there are no locks on the doors and thus no privacy and then the seduction. Who would be the cad then?So I think Wilder meant for the audience to sympathize with Joe. Sure he makes some questionable moral moves but he is to some degree cornered. He would have to get a hand out from somebody to go back to his job that he hates at the copy desk in Ohio and his pride wouldn't let him. Also some say he becomes attracted to Norma. He at best is giving her pity sex and at worst duty sex. He looks either revolted or bored every time she touches him.There are just great performances and interesting characters all around. Unpopular opinion here - I never thought Gloria Swanson was a pretty woman but she had such severe features that she could come across as an attractive yet unhinged woman for age 50 as Norma. Eric Von Stroheim as Max. He was a great director who lets his obsession with Norma delude them both. And then there is Betty Schaefer the down to earth girl who does the 50s thing and gets engaged to a man the way you would buy a car - she picks something reliable and likeable and omits passion from the equation. And then she finds passion. There could have been a sequel noir with her married to the dull dutiful Artie when she begins to call the mailman by his first name. The postman would only have to ring once in her case. But I digress.This is also a great look at Hollywood and Paramount Studios as it existed in 1950. It's too bad we don't have more actual films from Paramount Studios as it existed in 1950. To me this is a perfect film.,3 September 2021
"""Mr. Wilder I'm ready for my close-up""","Billy Wilder and Charles Brackett were about the best writing team in Hollywood for more than three decades. ""Sunset Boulevard"" shows the men at the pinnacle of their profession. Billy Wilder directed the film with his usual panache at this nostalgic look at a Hollywood that had faded almost a quarter of a century before. If you haven't seen the film please stop reading here.With the advent of the ""talkies"" a lot of film stars of the silent era lost their privileged positions as the most admired people in movies. When the new generation appeared in the scene they were more accessible to the fans that flocked to see the new technique in the movies that came out. One of those movies stars Norma Desmond lives in the past as she never adapted to the new reality which is evident in the way she stays out of the scene dwelling in her antiquated castle on Sunset Boulevard.Enter Joe Gillis the man who never made it into the industry. As a writer all his screen plays were rejected by the studio machinery because they were not what the heads of the production departments wanted to produce or just were plain not interested. Joe Gillis comes into the Desmond mansion by accident and it's an accident he encounters on his way out of it! Tbe egotistical Norma Desmond lives in the her palatial home with Max Von Mayerberg the loyal servant who was himself somebody in the silent era. Norma falls for the young Gillis in ways she never expected but as a desperate woman she wants to possess what she can't otherwise buy even a man going through financial bad times the way Joe Gillis is.Billy Wilder got magnificent performances out of the three principals. William Holden had one of the best opportunities of his film career with Joe Gillis a character he wasn't even scheduled to play but which Montgomery Cliff handed to him in a silver platter when he refused to appear in the picture! Gloria Swanson having experienced that old Hollywood was a natural choice to play Norma which was perhaps the crowning role in her distinguished career. Erich Von Stroheim the great director himself is absolutely wonderful as Von Mayerling.We see some of the silent era stars such as Buster Keaton Hedda Hopper Anne C. Nilsson H.B. Warner as well as Cecil B. DeMille the director of Hollywood epics par excellence.The great musical score of Franz Waxman enhances the film. John Seitz black and white photography brings us back to that time. Ultimately it's the genius of Billy Wilder that keeps things in balance showing a man who understood movies as perhaps the only one that could have directed the classic ""Sunset Boulevard"".",29 August 2005
'Crumbling apart in slow motion.',Down on his luck writer Joe Gillis is desperate for cash one day he breaks down outside the home of reclusive silent actress Norma Desmonde who quickly moves him in and imagines returning to Hollw8.My first time watching it and I was engrossed from start to finish it's a fascinating film the storyline crosses several different genres it's somehow a blend of psychological thriller and horror. You know the conclusion before the film even gets going the rest of the film is focused on Joe Gillie's journey.No wonder this film has such an illustrious reputation it really is a captivating watch. It's haunting it's a bleak reminder that not every Hollywood career was stars and Oscars some careers ended up on the scrap heap.Gloria Swanson delivers an outstanding performance she should have won The Oscar for it those eyes and facial expressions she's fabulous I loved that Charlie Chaplin sequence. William Holden is equally terrific I'd say the same applies Oscar worthy.The acting is of course wonderful but it's also immaculately produced it's very well presented and moves along very quickly it defies its age made all the way back in 1950.10/10.,28 January 2023
She Doesn't Want To Be Alone,"""Sunset Blvd."" is the funniest movie ever made about the saddest of human conditions loneliness.Struggling screenwriter Joe Gillis (William Holden) bounces around Hollywood like a pinball flipped at every turn by the big wheels who ignore his attempts to latch onto their world. Only the repo men want his company. Then he finds himself in the mansion of forgotten screen legend Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson) decked out as a memorial to someone not yet dead. Norma believes the world awaits her return (""I hate that word"" she says of ""comeback""). In her effort to elude time's heartless march she abandons sanity and bids Joe join her.Billy Wilder's film is a satire of Hollywood with a nod in the direction of Evelyn Waugh's ""The Loved One"" (Norma initially assumes Joe is here to help bury her pet chimp). As a satire it scores points but it's as a twisted love story that it makes its mark as a cinematic masterpiece. Norma fantasizes about her comeback but it's her love of Joe that destroys her. Everyone talks about Joe's self-loathing as a foregone conclusion of his finding himself in Norma's presence and turning himself into a gigolo but I think he's always carrying that dislike around his self-inflicted price for failing to achieve what he wants from life and a prison of loneliness every bit as desolate as Norma's mansion. One might wonder to what extent that more than Norma serves as his ruin.It's also a marvelous black comedy both of tone and out-and-out belly laughs whether it's Joe getting unsolicited advice in the men's clothing shop (""As long as the lady is paying for it why not take the Vicuna?"") or his narrating how gentle people get with a person after he's dead. Holden's especially great in his voice-over work letting every line stick with just the right amount of emphasis and no hint of actorliness.Swanson's all actorliness of course in that magnificent way of hers which provides so much of the empathy and madcap zaniness to the film. Like Gene Wilder in ""Young Frankenstein"" she draws you in with her amazing eyes and makes you laugh and cringe simultaneously at her most emotive outbursts. It's a comic showcase from one not known for comedy or for working in sound.Was Norma always this affected? A glimpse of her in one of her old movies (Swanson again in her unreleased ""Queen Kelly"") shows a retrained luminous presence not at all like the Norma we meet in the story. If this Norma played anyone on the silent screen it would have more likely been Nosferatu. Just watch those hands of hers twist and pull especially when she's drawing Joe deeper in her web.Norma doesn't mean to harm Joe. She just has no idea how real relationships work. To her like mad Max her butler (Erich von Stroheim a curiously shifting centerpiece whose true nature drives the point home) keeping people around is all that keeps her from a chasm of despair. When she talks to Joe or addresses her imagined audience it's not with the coldness of a user but real heart and soul. Unlike Garbo she most emphatically does not want to be alone and we can't help but like her for it.""Sunset Blvd."" makes a subtle brilliant case that staving off loneliness to such a degree makes for a sickness all its own. I'm not sure whether or not that's the most depressing thing about the film but it certainly adds to the power of its singular sting.",10 October 2006
A film packed with unforgettable moments,"Although at that time she hadn't appeared in a film for several years and wasn't to make one for several for several more Gloria Swanson remained a presence in the Hollywood of the thirties the only legendary silent star to sustain an image and continue to interest the film studios which put her under contract and announced her to star in a series of projectsnone of which were realized While she wasn't to regain her former eminence until her celebrated comeback as Norma Desmond in Billy Wilder's ""Sunset Boulevard"" a scathing satire on Hollywood and the self-delusions of its former heroes she maintained her silent-screen image as the personification of glamor and as such wasn't the initial choice for the role of the faded silent star Like many small people who achieve greatness Swanson was a powerhouse of energy vitality ambition and shrewdness untroubled by insight humor to slow down her pace The key to her success the charm of her personality the glamor of her career and the secret of her survival was superbly captured by herself in one of the best autobiographies Swanson on Swanson",15 April 2007
weird bizarre fascinating great,"This movie deserves all the accolades it has gotten here as well as ""Maltin's"" four stars. It certainly ranks up there as one of Hollywood's greatest achievements. Seeing it again only reinforces my opinion that William Holden was one of the truly great actors of the last [!] century. Gloria Swanson however steals every scene she's in; you can't turn away from watching her even though she makes you really uncomfortable - it's like watching a train wreck. I don't know if the black & white was an economic or an artistic choice but the film would never have been as effective in color. The opening shot - the floating dead body of Joe Gillis eyes wide open shot looking up from the bottom of the pool - is one of the great shots and an unforgettable opener matched perfectly by the unforgettable closing closeup of Norma Desmond. To have Cecil B. deMille actually play himself was an inspired touch. Throw in Eric von Stroheim and you have an unbeatable combination. Truly one the all-time must-see films although I don't know how to classify it - film noir? black comedy? Hollywood fable ? horror story? psychodrama? Who cares; just see it.",26 March 2001
Living In The Past,"The advent of the talkies created possibly the biggest-ever upheaval in the history of Hollywood and the impact it had on the careers of a large number of the industry's popular stars at that time was enormous. Many whose voices seemed unacceptable because they were incompatible with their image or because of a heavy foreign accent found themselves out of work as did others who were simply unable to adapt to the demands of the new era. Billy Wilder's ""Sunset Boulevard"" provides a fascinating insight into some of the more ruthless and unpleasant facets of the Hollywood system in a style that's witty cynical and realistic and also features a number of actors whose careers were profoundly affected by the arrival of the talkies.Joe Gillis (William Holden) a struggling Hollywood screenwriter with more debts than he can handle becomes involved in a high-speed chase when he tries to avoid the attentions of a couple of guys who are intent on repossessing his car. When one of his tyres blows out he swiftly turns into the driveway of a run down mansion and successfully evades his pursuers. After parking his vehicle in the garage he's surprised that the occupants of the mansion seem to be expecting him. It soon transpires that they'd assumed that he was the mortician who was due to deliver a coffin in which the lady of the house's dead chimpanzee was to be buried. Joe recognises the lady as Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson) a former silent movie star.When Norma discovers that Joe's a writer she seeks his opinion of a script she'd written for her comeback movie (""Salome"") and then hires him to edit her work. In his financial circumstances the offer of this lucrative job is too good to refuse and at her request he agrees to stay at her mansion to complete the task. Joe recognises that Norma is a delusional has-been who lives in the past and discovers that the fan mail she receives every week is actually written by her devoted butler Max (Erich von Stroheim). The very wealthy Norma buys Joe expensive new suits and coats and together they watch her old movies a few times each week. Even more bizarrely on New Year's Eve she holds a party at which there's an orchestra but no other guests! Joe feels he needs to escape from Norma who's obviously fallen in love with him and so goes to a friend's party instead.Artie Green (Jack Webb) agrees for Joe to stay over at his place and Joe soon gets into conversation with Artie's girlfriend Betty Schaefer (Nancy Olsen). Joe already knew Betty who worked as a script reader for Paramount and the two of them subsequently start to work together on one of Joe's unfinished scripts. When Norma discovers what's going on she becomes incensed and determined to bring their association to an end.The most striking feature of ""Sunset Boulevard"" is its sharp dialogue and numerous quotable lines which vary from the purely witty to the deeply sardonic. The fact that these lines are delivered by a screenwriter and a particularly flamboyant retired actress makes their exchanges seem perfectly credible as both characters would naturally have developed a way with words during their careers.The film's opening scene in which Joe is seen dead and face down in Norma's swimming pool is brilliantly shot and the off-beat device of having a dead man narrating the story is typical of the cynicism and dark humour that runs through everything that follows. At this point when objectively talking about himself Joe in typical style remarks ""the poor dope. He always wanted a pool. Well in the end he got himself a pool"".The casting of Gloria Swanson and Erich von Stroheim who both had careers in silent movies invests the events depicted with a great deal of realism as do the cameos in which Cecil B DeMille Hedda Hopper Buster Keaton and others are featured. Shots of Paramount studios and Schwab's Drugstore and the inclusion of an excerpt from ""Queen Kelly"" (1929) in which Swanson starred and von Stroheim directed also blur the lines between fiction and reality and add greater authenticity to the whole production.""Sunset Boulevard"" focuses on some of the more unglamourous aspects of Hollywood and must've made uncomfortable viewing for some people in the industry at that time. Its blend of biting humour and tragedy is very effective and the performances of its exceptional cast are consistently good from start to finish.",2 February 2015
A Bitter and Tragic Masterpiece,"In Hollywood of the 50's the obscure screenplay writer Joe Gillis (William Holden) is not able to sell his work to the studios is full of debts and is thinking in returning to his hometown to work in an office. While trying to escape from his creditors he has a flat tire and parks his car in a decadent mansion in Sunset Boulevard. He meets the owner and former silent-movie star Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson) who lives alone wit her butler and driver Max von Mayerling (Erich von Stroheim). Norma is demented and believes she will return to the cinema industry and is protected and isolated from the world by Max who was his director and husband in the past and still loves her. Norma proposes Joe to move to the mansion and help her in writing a screenplay for her comeback to the cinema and the small-time writer becomes her lover and gigolo. When Joe falls in love for the young aspirant writer Betty Schaefer (Nancy Olson) Norma becomes jealous and completely insane and her madness leads to a tragic end.""Sunset Boulevard"" is a bitter and tragic masterpiece of the genius Billy Wilder that exposes how Hollywood uses people and forgets them when they get old and are considered decadent by the industry. Further it also shows the consequences of the lack of adaptation of a former star to the end of a successful career being forgotten by fans and the industry and the price that some persons accept to pay to join this business. The last time I saw this film was on 22 September 2002 and even having watched ""Sunset Boulevard"" for maybe five or six times I still get excited with most of the scenes and I dare to say that it is in my Top 10 movies ever. The DVD has an interesting documentary called ""Sunset Blvd.: A Look Back"" (a.k.a. ""The Making of Sunset Boulevard"" with the presence of a still impressively beautiful Nancy Olson telling peculiarities about this awesome feature. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): ""Crepúsculo dos Deuses"" (""Dusk of the Gods"")",18 January 2008
Alright Sunset BLVD are you ready for your close up?,The movie is still big. It's the pictures that got small. There is nothing like watching Sunset Boulevard. It's a great movie that need to be in the center of attention. Name after a Boulevard in Los Angeles this film noir was directed and co-written by Billy Wilder who destroy forever the iconic Hollywood image with his dark tale of greed and the lust of everlasting fame. The film stars William Holden as Joe Gillis an unsuccessful screenwriter who happen to come upon a faded silent movie starlet Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson) who draws him into her fantasy world where she dreams of making a triumphant return to the screen. William Holden is great in the role as a man struggling to keep his masculinity. I like his moral decision in the end of the film. Serve them right. In a way this movie was indeed William Holden comeback film as well as he fallen from the starlight after 1939's Golden Boys. Gloria Swanson is scary charming and brilliant in the Femme fatale manipulative role. She does over act a bit but that comes with the part. She's pretty much playing an extreme version of herself. Gloria herself was trying to have a comeback with this film after a number of fails films include one with Director Erich von Stroheim in 1929's Queen Kelly. Art is mirroring real life as Erich von Stroheim stars as Max Von Mayerling her butler and the director that discovered her. There is even a chilling theater scene with all the main characters watching the film Queen Kelly. Erich von Stroheim is just amazing in this film and I have become a fan of his works. I didn't like Nancy Olson so much as Betty Schaefer as I felt she was way too chirpy for my taste and in your face shouting acting. I do like the silent film stars cameos like Director Cecil B. DeMille Buster Keaton H. B. Warner and Anna Q. Nilsson. I do like the cameo of the set of 1949's DeMille's Samson and Delilah. It makes the film seems more real to Hollywood to know that another real life film was really taking place there. While the characters could had been nearly unlikeable Billy Wilder's comedy charm gives this movie some room to breathe. I have to praise the writing. It's amazing. Yes some of the jokes went over my head but the film was balance well enough for the drama and the comedy not to feel overloaded. The narrative of film noirs are usually characterized as multifaceted and often confusing. It does commonly entailing the use of flashback and first-person voice-over narration. I'm pretty glad they open the film with the shot of the swimming pool rather than having two corpses talking to each other at the morgue. I think it does sound stupid so I'm glad they use the dead body in the swimming pool idea. The corpse floating in the pool in the film's opening scene. The desired image proved difficult to achieve and the problem was resolved by placing mirrors on the bottom of the swimming pool and filming from above. The underwater shot was pretty impressed at the time. The visual effects are amazing. Sunset Boulevard uses a lot of high-contrast lighting in Norma's house that creates dark shadows that works well. The lighting and the setting is to show the character is suffocating in their life. Norma is ever looking for the light. I love the foggy blur that it create when people get near it. It's symbolism at its best. The film also contains some German-expressionistic element such as the oblique vertical and horizontal angles. For some interior shots the crew sprinkled dust in front of the camera before filming to suggest dirty or unclean. The house was old and nice. The way the photographs were surrounding. It look like some odd Gothic church. The house was later used by Nicholas Ray's 1955's Rebel Without a Cause. It was pretty interesting. The score was composed by Franz Waxman was pretty good. Nothing worth noting compare to today's standards. It was just OK at best for me. Here are some faults in the film in my opinion. The narrating goes a little bit too long. Show don't tell. Plus how do dead-men can do a narration anyways? Aren't they dead? The whole blooming Gillis-Betty relationship seem out of place as well. I know it's needed for the plot but it's seem forced. I just don't see Betty having much interested in a man she barely sees. The story was a bit influence by the real life tragedy of Mabel Normand and William Desmond Taylor in which William Desmond got shot and killed. This film marks the first time that Hollywood was view in a negative light on film. The theme of this movie is that Hollywood creates dreams and stars and then leaves them with nothing but their own outdated fantasies. In the other side of the coin some people are so hungry for the fame that they are willing to do anything for a shot at it even destroying lives. Hollywood still love and hate the film for its criticism of the movie industry. It's still a bit controversial ever today. Wilder show us the real Hollywood where few people had success and many fails. People mustn't starve for fame too long else they risk being trapped in a world of their own making a world where they become bitter and delude.,6 September 2013
Reel Life Gothic,"Every time I go to L.A. which isn't too often I look at these palm-bemused once smart stucco facades and wonder if a Norma Desmond from a later era might be hiding from the world inside them buttressed by cable TV (AMC or TCM no doubt) a poodle named FiFi or Sir Francis walk-in closets full of leopard-print Capri pants that haven't fit in decades and a world class liquor cabinet that has seen heads of state under the table on a good night. It is because of Sunset Blvd. for certain that my mind could ever go there. It is one of the most indelible films you will ever see.This film is great for many reasons not the least of which is because it is Hollywood's first look back at itself. In the milieu of this film the silent era is only 22 years behind us. The people left behind by the rush to sound can still palpably TASTE the fame the accolade that particular past being not so very dim and distant. The sadness of their lives was real and at that point in history all around if hidden. Way more has been made of the supposed ""savagery"" of this film vis a vis the faded star than I think exists now or ever did. The often cynical Wilder is deeply in touch with the tragic here as much as the grotesque.",16 September 2001
The Wild Roller-coaster of Fame,In many ways Sunset Boulevard is like the reverse side of the coin of A Star Is Born. In that film we have young Vicki Lester going through all the travails and heartache before achieving her goal of movie stardom. Sunset Boulevard is the reverse. A Star Is Born has its tragic figure in Norman Maine who commits suicide rather than face being a has been. In Sunset Boulevard we have the character of Norma Desmond who has not taken that route. She lacks for nothing in the material world she wisely saved and invested her money. But the acclaim of the audience is a drug she craves. She's been at the top on the celebrity roller-coaster and now is at the bottom.Into her life comes Joe Gillis quite accidentally. Fleeing from some repo men looking to take his car Gillis drives into the garage of what he thinks is a deserted mansion. It looks pretty run down from the outside. Gillis compares it to the house of Miss Faversham from Great Expectations little knowing how right he was.Billy Wilder was a casting genius though in some ways he fell into the cast he had. Gloria Swanson was not his first choice he approached both Mary Pickford and Pola Negri for the Desmond role first. Gloria Swanson who actually had made the transition to sound well but had gone on to stage and radio since her success in Music in the Air drew from the experiences of many of her colleagues. At the time she was cast in Sunset Boulevard she had a radio show out of New York.Bill Holden was sheer serendipity. Originally Montgomery Clift was to do the part but at the last minute he said no feeling that this was to similar a part to the one he played in The Heiress. Wilder then went through the list of contract leading men at Paramount.Wilder saw something in Holden God bless him. Holden had done a whole series of what he termed 'smiling Jim' roles. He was considered an amiable and non-threatening leading man. Although he had done well in a role as a psychotic killer in The Dark Past Sunset Boulevard brought him his first real acclaim as an actor. An Academy Award nomination came with the acclaim.Nancy Olson and Erich Von Stroheim were nominated in the Best Supporting Player categories as was Swanson for Best Actress. Von Stroheim was another inspired choice. His is a strange part indeed. He was Desmond's first director in silent films and left his career behind to take care of her. He was also her first husband. Sunset Boulevard for it's time and with the Code firmly in place was a brutal look at the sexual needs of a middle-aged woman. Before Holden knows it he's giving up his life as an aspiring screenwriter to be a kept gigolo. He doesn't like it but can't leave it. When he does it results in tragedy.Nancy Olson plays a reader at Paramount studios where Holden is trying to sell a script. She and Holden had good chemistry and after this they did four more films together. Casting Cecil B. DeMille as himself was of necessity for who could play the great DeMille but DeMille. DeMille in fact was a former actor and playwright at the turn of the last century. In his autobiography DeMille lets us in on a private joke. He in fact did direct many of Gloria Swanson's early silent films and a pet name he had for her was 'young fella.' Note that when Norma Desmond comes to the Paramount lot to see him he greets her with that same expression. Note that DeMille got a plug for his own film Samson and Delilah which was in production at the same time. It is the set of that film where Swanson and DeMille meet.You will never forget the finely etched characters of Sunset Boulevard. You can see it many times as I've done but if you see it only once you will have it burned in your memory. Especially that last scene before the newsreel cameras where Swanson loses whatever sanity she has left. She descends down the stairs of her mansion and descends into the comfort of insanity.I've often wondered should a sequel have been done covering the trial of Norma Desmond. I'm sure Billy Wilder wanted to move on to other projects. Still that would have been a film to see.,26 January 2006
They Don't Make 'Em Like This Anymore,"This is such a great film on so many levels I can't really settle on where to begin. It is so beautifully shot (in that stark black/white that only nitrate negative could achieve) has a witty clever and extremely well-written script features some of the best acting in film's history acrobatically balances the main plot/subplots with expert precision contains some of the best characters on celluloid has many true-to-life parallels (Swanson's career/real life cameos/DeMille's involvement/etc) and is peppered with such great dialogue/narration that today's film writers should take note. If that weren't enough there's even a cameo by silent film great Buster Keaton (among others).One of the most appealing aspects of this film is how in the story an aging forgotten star is trying to recapture a bygone era (the silent film era). What's interesting is that now so many years later we're looking back at her looking back. To present day viewers Gloria Swanson of the 1950's is a long forgotten lost gem and to experience her own longing for the 1920's is especially captivating (and a little chilling I might add). I don't think this film could have had that same effect when it debuted and maybe this added dimension holds so much more appeal for today's audiences. We all know that nothing lasts forever but we don't often consider the abandoned participants; much like the veterans of a past war.In response to the famous Swanson line (while watching one of her silent films): ""...we didn't need dialogue; we had faces"" I'd like to also add that they ""didn't need movies; they had films.""They truly don't make them like this anymore. 10/10",2 July 2004
The films that SHOULD have won Oscar for Best Picture: 1951,"This was the first of Billy Wilder's work I've even seen sure I've heard of him just not seen any of his movies. Made in the fifty's ""Sunset Blvd."" is simply timeless & it's easy to see why this movie of a washed up writer/ turned gigolo to a washed-up has-been actress is rated so highly. A superb indictment of everything that's wrong and distasteful about Hollywood and probably even truer now that it actually was when it was made. This film is also crammed with in-jokes and references that practically beg for multiple viewings. The acting by everyone is perfect & this movie is such a wonder to behold.DVD Extras: Audio commentary with author of ""On Sunset Boulevard: The Life And Times Of Billy Wilder"" Ed Sikov ; Three featureless (""The Making Of Sunset Boulevard""; ""The Music Of Sundet Boulevard"" and ""Edith Head: The Paramount Years"") ;Morgue prologue; ""Hollywood Location"" map;Photo galleries; Theatrical trailerMy Grade: A+",18 December 2004
All right Mr. DeMille,"Gloria Swanson must be commended for her bravery in taking a part which may or may not have echoed her own Hollywood career. William Holden took a role which required him to be a kept boy; and he's not the nicest guy in the world either. If this had been made with Mae West and Montgomery Clift I would probably not be writing this and no one else would give a damn about this movie either.Both of them got Oscar nominations and I am sorry both lost. I am also sorry that ""All About Eve"" won Best Picture that year. Of course ""Eve"" is a great movie but its not this.This movie is part of our collective memory and most of the dialogue continues to be quoted even today. Thank God for whatever it was that brought Billy Wilder to Hollywood. I can't think of anyone who did such a wide variety of movies so well.And please no remakes.",14 March 2000
"Says Holden: ""I sure drove into an interesting driveway...""","WILLIAM HOLDEN really hits his stride in the role of Joe Gillis the down-on-his-heels writer who just happens to be drowning in debt before he comes upon a secluded and decaying mansion that is about to change his life. Wilder's script gives him plenty of opportunity to shine. His typically witty quip to servant Erich Von Stroheim is: ""I sure drove into an interesting driveway"" (after realizing Swanson intends to hold a funeral for her pet monkey). It's the kind of remark that stays with you through the entire story.Holden inhabits the role so perfectly that we can be thankful Montgomery Clift turned down the role at the last moment. And the screenplay by Billy Wilder provides plenty of other cynical and observant wise cracks that give his character of Joe Gillis such depth conviction and truth.And of course GLORIA SWANSON as Norma Desmond in what has to be regarded as her film swansong (she did very little thereafter) is every inch the faded silent screen star who lives inside her rich imagination inflating her ego with self-important phrases like: ""It's the pictures that got small."" With her cat-like eyes and claw-like hand gestures she gets every nuance out of a role that is theatrical and larger than life right up to the fantastic ending. One can almost sense why Andrew Lloyd Webber would fashion this into a terrific Broadway musical.Her meeting with Cecil B. DeMille on the set of a Paramount costume epic is priceless for the way it is written and played. When at the conclusion of the film she says: ""I'm ready for my close-up Mr. DeMille"" it's a truly poignant moment.All of the supporting players are excellent including NANCY OLSON as the writer girlfriend that Holden shields from the truth until that final scene where he invites her to come over to the Sunset Blvd. mansion and exposes the sordid truth of his relationship with Swanson.As the man servant who is Swanson's loyal protector and was once Swanson's first husband and director of her early films ERICH VON STROHEIM easily matches Holden and Swanson with a fine characterization of the patiently devoted butler.Swanson plays the demented star like a more glamorous version of Miss Havisham in GREAT EXPECTATIONS the woman who lived among the cobwebs because of a bitter disappointment when a lover jilted her on her wedding day. And like Miss Havisham she refuses to deal with the reality of her situation when the going gets rough--as it does when it turns out nobody wants her at the studios any more they were only interested in her antique auto.Some old time Hollywoodians get some cameos (Buster Keaton H.B. Warner) which give the film added interest and even Hedda Hopper is on the scene as a brusque Hollywood reporter. All of the technical details are perfect. Franz Waxman's score has a Salome-like flavor especially toward the end when Swanson is in the full throes of her delusions.Expertly photographed written directed and acted this is a film that has to be watched closely to fully appreciate every detail. With its superior script it mixes film noir black comedy and dark melodrama with a nice blend of shadowy noir B&W photography that has that Paramount sheen. A viewer is immediately drawn into the story which gets off to a brilliant start with Holden's brittle narration the kind that strips all the phoniness away from any Hollywood pretension of glamor. Summing up: Highly recommended for mature adults. Holden's corpse floating face downward eyes open in the water of the lighted swimming pool is the stylish stuff that film noir addicts dream of.And Swanson's brief moment mimicking Charlie Chaplin is priceless.Trivia note: Holden's performance is right on target--the perfect degree of cynicism disdain and self-loathing. He should have won an Oscar here.",28 August 2005
Masterpiece.,I dare any studio producer director to make TODAY anything even close to that film.,1 August 2019
very special look at Hollywood,Not a romanticised view of Tinseltown at all this Billy Wilder movie was more or less ignored on release - the year that All About Eve took all the awards and the kudos. It is a bitter pill to swallow since it takes a kick at Hollywood's guts and has one of the bleakest endings in the whole of cinema.Joe Gillis a struggling writer finds himself in the drive of a Hollywood palazzo when he wants somewhere to hide his car. The house belongs to Norma Desmond who 'used to be big' in pictures and Joe gets drawn to Norma and drawn into her weird world of flickering shadows.The acting honours in this movie go squarely to Gloria Swanson herself a 'star of yesteryear' as Norma who is superb as the actress living in the past. Not that she plays Norma as exclusively tragic(the scene where she impersonates Chaplin is priceless) but perhaps no one could get to grips with the demands of this part better. William Holden plays Joe his breakthrough role and he does the part very well while Erich von Stroheim plays faded Hollywood director Max von Mayerling (naturally a reflection of himself) and newcomer Nancy Olson plays Betty a girl too nice to become submerged just yet in dreamland's poison.The script is its moments of OTT-ness but it is never less than interesting and draws in the viewer to the point when you are with Norma when she visits her old studio and talks of the joy of coming home; you are with Joe and Nancy as they fall in love among the cardboard settings of movie sets; and you are in the hall with Hedda Hopper watching Norma's last descent into madness. The musical version which appeared in the 1990s had the heart and soul of this movie in mind and was an excellent tribute to it.,21 March 2004
"""Who wants real? Who wants moving?""","With a medium like cinema which had such a distinct and holistic culture all of its own it is bound sooner or later to lose itself in nostalgia. Either that or cynical self-parody. Sunset Boulevard is not about the way motion pictures were – it is about the way motion picture people were and continued to be.Indeed the style of Sunset Boulevard was the very epitome of modern film-making – voice-over narration fluid camera-work crisp cinematography. These contemporary trappings really serve to deepen the contrast and sharpen the disrespectful onslaught upon the olden days. Take the protagonist voice-over something writers Billy Wilder and Charles Brackett really made an art of. It may often be functional cutting corners in the narrative or elucidating on screen events but more often than not it is superfluous to the story and acts as a kind of enjoyably wry commentary on proceedings. It's a stylistic layer as much as the overstuffed set design and chiaroscuro lighting.Director Billy Wilder is often said (by Ed Sikov for example) to be someone who ""does not call attention to the shot"". On the contrary he actually constantly grabs us with the images. While he was never fond of obvious trickery Wilder loves the weirdness of natural effects – such as Swanson's face skull-like in her sunglasses or the close-up on her spinning parasol which begins the bathing beauties routine. He is great at filling the shot with ""clues"" and reminders bringing them to our attention at the right moment – such as those holes in the doors where the locks should be which a line in the dialogue has made us associate with suicide attempts.But this is really a movie about stars and central to Sunset Boulevard is the performance by Gloria Swanson. It was incredibly brave of Swanson to play such a brazen caricature of the kind of woman she could have become. But she brings all her long-standing talent and the knowledge of experience into the role. Norma Desmond is as much a creation of Swanson as she is of Wilder and Brackett. She has the kind of sleek animalistic movement of a silent-era vamp but tinges it with a frank depiction of middle-aged indignity. Her acting may be exaggerated and far from realistic but remember she is playing a woman for whom life has become an act. Swanson is hammy because hamminess is real for that character. She clearly knew exactly what she was doing and what the pictures was about. Compare that to DeMille who really had no sense of irony and it's amazing he agreed to appear here. His performance is assuredly naturalistic (and ironically far better than most of what passes for acting in his own pictures) although that is also perfect for the part he plays here – being himself! Whether or not he had agreed to appear DeMille would have been a central figure to this story. He was really the sole survivor of the silent era; the only individual – star producer or director – from that time who was still a top dog. And although Sunset Boulevard sets its sights on the Hollywood of yesteryear it was really the Hollywood of 1950 that Wilder and Brackett were gunning for. Like Norma Desmond the post-war industry had passed its heyday and was really living off the receipts of its past glories. The studio system was crumbling and TV was encroaching on its territory just as sound had encroached on Norma's thirty years earlier. It was now the more modest productions by younger free-spirited filmmakers – productions like Sunset Boulevard itself – that were beginning to rise to the surface.",14 April 2010
A hack writer in search of refuge from creditors hides into a crumbling mansion inhabited by a faded silent movie star,This excellent movie with bitter-sweet style deal with a hack  bankrupt screenwriter who writes a screenplay for a former silent-film star who has faded into Hollywood obscurity . It starts in the surprising opening scene by having the flick related by a body floating face-down in a swimming pool . What follows in long flashback is pulls into an ancient mansion in which a writer in search of refuge from his creditors  as he shelters and becomes entangled in the web woven by a known but now forgotten star of the silent cinema  being submitted to humiliation and exploitation . The star named Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson) is high on hopes of a comeback and living in the past with her servant (Erich Von Stroheim). One of Wilder's finest and certainly the blackest and memorably sour of all Hollywood accounts of itself . Splendidly paced  the movie contains melodrama  acidity  bitterness  relentless indictment against Hollywood excesses  suitable sordid interpretations and precise direction . It's an over-the-top picture  though hampered by silly sub-plot related to sentimental triangle between William Holden Nancy Olson and Jack Webb . Magnificent performances from William Holden as out-of-work gigolo-screenwriter who inextricably attaches himself to a faded possessive screen star ; Swanson is brilliant as the tragically deluded actress and realizes a real tour-de-force and of course superb Erich Von Stroheim as Norma Desmond's devotedly watchable butler . Likable appearing in brief card-game scenes from silent stars as H.B. Warner and Buster Keaton  furthermore Hedda Hooper and extraordinary intervention by Cecil B DeMille while filming some scenes of ¨Ten Commandments¨ with Henry Wilconson . This prestigious film deservedly won three Oscars  including best musical score by Franz Waxman  and best screenplay by Wilder and Charles Brackett . Awesome camera-work appropriately ¨Noir¨ by John Seitz .The picture is stunningly directed by Billy Wilder at his best . It belongs his first and better period during the 40s and 50s when realized sensational films as ¨Double indemnity¨ ¨Ace in the hole¨  ¨Sabrina¨ ¨Stalag 17¨ and ¨Seven year itch¨ ; subsequently in the 60s and 70s he realized nice though unsuccessful movies as ¨Buddy buddy¨¨Fedora¨  ¨Front page¨and ¨Secret life of Sherlock Holmes¨. Rating : Above average  essential and indispensable watching ; harshly funny and riveting film and completely entertaining . It justly deserves its place among the best movies ever made .,16 September 2011
